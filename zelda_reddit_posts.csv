zelda,"[SS] Minor, yet cool detail I just noticed",False,175,0,"So in the opening cutscene when it is showing Zelda singing and Groose, Strich, and Cawlin jumping off onto their Loftwings, it shows Link's Crimson Loftwing flying past right before and then shows the three mentioned boys getting on their's right after and then chasing after the Crimson Loftwing. And then later, you have to go find the Loftwing and rescue it from its trap that Groose made. In other words, you can actually see Groose and the other two chasing after the bird in the opening cutscene and I think it's super cool that they gave a little easter egg to later events in the game.",,5,,175,,public
zelda,[LA] New Glitch / Memory Exploit get photos early Link's Awakening DX,False,40,0,"I've accidentally discovered a way to unlock photos early in Link's Awakening, and, if researched more, it may be possible to unlock the ""Steal from Shop"" photo without causing your name to be changed to THIEF.

It started as I was farming enemies for a piece of power and I unexpectedly suddenly had the Red Tunic from the color dungeon. This is an already-known memory overflow glitch which I executed by accident, if you don't know about it, it's detailed here: [https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches\_in\_Link%27s\_Awakening#Obtaining\_Colored\_Tunics\_Without\_Visiting\_the\_Color\_Dungeon\_(Including\_Extra\_%22Damage\_Sprite\_Tunic%22)](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches_in_Link%27s_Awakening#Obtaining_Colored_Tunics_Without_Visiting_the_Color_Dungeon_(Including_Extra_%22Damage_Sprite_Tunic%22))

However, as I paused the game to see yep, I have the red tunic, I also saw my photo count - it said I had 1 out of 12 photos. I hadn't been to the camera guy yet. So curious, I went to the camera guy, got my photo taken... and now it says have 2 out of 12 photos. I inspected the album, and found that in addition to the starting photo, I also had the Zora-At-the-Pond photo, which is impossible, since I only finished the first dungeon.

I've tried to reproduce this and I'm not sure how. Somehow the enemy count memory exploit can do more than just change your tunic - it can unlock photos too! So I'm wondering - the most annoying photo in LA is one that forces you to choose between keeping your name or having full photo completion. With this exploit, if exact details get figured out, you might be able finish the album and keep your name.

I've tried to search online and can't find any other detail of unlocking photos using this memory glitch. Does anyone have any detailed knowledge of this? Or know where I could go to find people who do?

The only thing I was doing differently from the tunic glitch is I had Bow Wow with me so he was eating enemies at the same time which made it hard to farm the exact number of baddies.",,2,,40,,public

zelda,r/Zelda Meta Discussion - Rule 3: Art Sources Required,False,5,0,"Hi r/Zelda,

To continue discussing the subreddit itself, with goals both to inform readers and to gather feedback, I intend to write up a series of weekly posts detailing each of the rules and their changes over the years. These will be added to the Meta Discussions collection, so you can opt-in to get notified for these posts if you ""follow"" the collection. With 13 rules, it should take a season to get through all of these.

---

**Rule 3 - Art Sources Required** is our rule on Fan Art and our requirements for properly sourcing them. As listed in our [Short Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/about/rules/) and [Long Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules), this rule specifies that all Fan Art Post Titles must include attribution to the artist by name or claim, and if the post is not OC or does not include a direct link itself, then a comment containing a direct link to the original art page is required. 

The core purpose of Art Sources Required is to inform readers about who is the original author and to whom the credit or further attention should be directed. In general, this rule is well-followed except by spammers and by users who need reminded to read the rules - we are a lot more lenient with the latter than the former.

Below is a timeline of when we updated our rule for Art Sources Required. This rule dates back to the beginning of the subreddit, but it has changed a few times since then, especially as the features and nature of reddit has changed over the years.

The rules as listed on the /about/rules page had been reordered earlier on June 23rd.

In practice, this rule calls for moderator attention to every Fan Art post, as we manually verify every source link to ensure that the correct artist is identified, that the artwork is linked properly, and that the artist permits (or does not forbid) their work to be reposted/rehosted if done so. Automoderator does most of the heavy lifting by reminding users to provide the source as well as directing the source comments to the mod queue for review.

We tend to be lenient with users, but we will issue bans to users that repeatedly post unsourced art or that rehost art against artists' wishes. We will remove the posts and issue warnings via comments or modmail to the user, and after several warnings we move to escalating bans for each infraction.

I do want to note that users that repeatedly break the Reddit User Agreement (i.e., uploading content for which the user does not have the rights) are subject to action from the Admins. This is related to the DMCA process as well, whereby the original copyright holders (artists) can submit claims to have their content removed. DMCA claims are not sent to us moderators, but we will also remove any content if the original artist reaches out to us directly via modmail or in the post comments.

---

So with the detailing of the history and reasons behind the rule listed out above, now I would like to ask for your thoughts and feedback regarding the rule. I will add current full-text copies of the rule in the comments below as well.

* Do you think any parts of the rule should be rephrased or clarified? 

* Do you think any components of the rule should be added, changed, or removed?

* How do you feel about the current state of Fan Art Requirements on r/Zelda?

* One area of ambiguity is when art is rehosted here and the original artist does not list any message either permitting nor forbidding their work to be reposted. We know some artists will appreciate their work being shared here (i.e. ""Repost with Credit""), while others do not (i.e. ""Do Not Repost""). In the ambiguous case, we currently allow the rehosted artworks to stay up, but this can be difficult to sort out if the original artist does not have a reddit account or if a language barrier exists. What do you think?

* Another recent area of contention is the rise of AI-generated art. Currently we allow AI Art to be posted, but we require the program used to be cited in the post title. We also change the flair to ""AI Art"". Do you have thoughts on AI-generated art on r/Zelda?",,2,,5,rito,public

zelda,[OTHER] Is anyone worried about a possible upcoming zelda movie?,False,3,0,"To me, a Studio Ghibli anime type always seemed so fitting for zelda movies - with room for lengthy camera sweeps of the natural scenery and micromoments of critters like fairies or octorocks finding mischief. The way those movies warrant so little dialogue seems so fitting. 

The cutscene to the remake of Links Awakening seemed perfect as well and I would love to see a whole movie in that style! 

But, with the new Mario movie being made with Illumination and the talk of a multiverse that leads up to super smash bros, I’m a little concerned that they aren’t going to switch up animation styles and a zelda movie is going to end up being… disappointing?

zelda,[WW] Thoughts about Gohma,False,0,0,"So, Gohma, the boss of Dragonroost Cavern.

Big Insectoid thing. Invulnerable in its hard outer shell. You drop the roof on him a few times, break the shell, reveal a fleshy vulnerable insectoid thing inside that you can fight.

Now, here's where this gets weird. It's insectoid right? So I've always just kind of assumed the hard outer shell is an exoskeleton.

But that's not how exokeletons work. If it was an exoskeleton then the thing would be hella dead after you crushed it. Just a mess of loose insectoid internal anatomy that was never meant to see the open air.

It really acts more like some kind of bone armor. A protective suit Gohma wears, just like how a human would.

But like, where does a thing like that get a suit of armor? Do you think Ganon made special armor for it?

It's weirdly kind of consistent with the other bosses of the game too. The Helmarock King has that iron mask it wears protecting its face, despite being a giant bird. Jahlhalla has that mask all the poes hop into to become the giant poe, like where did they find that? Kalideros and Molgera I've got nothing for though. They seem to just be monsters like you would expect.

She left it here for the weekend while she’s out of state visiting family, so I decided, hey, why not do a three heart run? I haven’t done one in this game since the GBA was new.

It’s kicking my butt pretty badly. I’m in dungeon six, and am struggling with the rooms that contain Wizzrobes, blue Wizzrobes, Like Likes, and Bubbles. I already got the magic rod, on the one attempt when I managed to get through, and after getting it I popped into dungeon eight for the magic book. I have the blue ring, magic shield, a red potion, and a good stockpile of bombs and rupees, so I think I’m about as prepared as I could hope to be… though I think the second bomb expansion is in dungeon seven, so I could also grab that I guess. I know there’s a red ring in Death Mountain, but you can’t get very far into it without the full Triforce, right?

Is there anything else I can do to get through more easily? I can’t really rely on bomb spam or chugging potion, because there’s one more room with the exact same grouping of enemies you have to go through before reaching the boss.",,0,,2,,public

zelda,[TP] Can we take a moment to appreciate Chudley’s Fine Goods and Fancy Trinkets Emporium?,False,19,0,"This is one of the most amazing pieces of comedy in any Zelda game. 

I love that the shop basically embodies the “better than you filthy commoners” approach to running a shop. You can’t even enter without paying 10 rupees to get your shoes shined, because this is a “rich people store”. 

When you do enter, everything is outrageously priced, and the shopkeeper has absolutely no sympathy for you. He emphasizes the high price point (1,000 Rupees. Got It!?) and then says “It sucks to be you”.

At first, you’re the butt of the Joke because let’s face it: You are poor.

All of this becomes way better when Malo Mart comes and replaces the shop, with much more affordable prices. This is all because your courage encouraged Malo to take responsibility and start selling stuff, and you funded his business with your Rupees. You caused this Robbery of a shop to become a respectable business for everyone, and it’s all because you were a big brother figure to a kid from your town.

So in the end, you had the last laugh, as Chudley is now doing that dumb ass dance for the rest of the game.

It’s brilliant. I could not have asked for a better laugh.

My shield breaks so I have to climb out of the ruins, enter the temple, travel through time, leave the temple, go back into the sky, enter the bazaar, only to get another lecture on the uses of an iron shield. I’ve gone through at least 50 shields in this one save, I don’t need the lecture again. 

Then you reverse all those steps to get back to the boss fight and BAM! The tactics change.

zelda,[OTHER] my pitch for a Zelda game with a female link,False,0,0,"Way back when botw was in development I heard a lot of discussion on the possibility of link being a girl. It got me thinking about how the story of a female link would go. So here's my idea for The Legend of Zelda: the Eighth Heroine.

This game's incarnation of link is the child of a hylian and a gerudo. Raised in a small village in the outskirts of the gerudo territory that sees regular trade with other regions. The gerudo are prospering under the rule of their king, born the generation before Link. Until king Ganondorf declares war on his neighbors. Any deserters are imprisoned, including Link's mother, as she flees her hometown into Hyrule with nothing but a gerudo sword and shield in hand. 

Link would be mistrusted in Hyrule, though a single teenager isn't considered enough of a threat since Ganondorf's army has het to launch any invasions. Link finds her father in search of help freeing her mother, and from there the dungeon crawls begin.

This link would have to explore both hylian and gerudo temples, collecting tools and magic from both. As she does she begins to earn the trust of the hylians she helps and gerudo begin to defect from Ganondorf as she walks in the footsteps of past gerudo heroes. Though many gerudo still view her as a traitor to their king. Eventually taking the fight to Ganondorf's castle the master sword in her left hand and gerudo magic in the right.

zelda,[ALL] Is Ocarina of Time still the most accessible game in the series?,False,4,0,"Hey guys, wanted to get a quick discussion going since I've been thinking about this for a while.

Regarding every mainline game in the series from LoZ to BotW, is Ocarina of Time the one that we as fans could easily say is the best one to get people into the series with? Disregarding superfluous stuff like  ""le hecking 99 on metacritic best game of all time!!"" and all that. I was thinking of all the other 3D games in the series and LA/ALttP (imo LoZ and AoL just aren't worth it for newcomers) and OoT seems to be the one in my mind that makes the most sense to be someone's first.

* When I think of the other 3D Games, Majora's Mask is an instant no from me and not because of the quality (great game imo) but rather the sheer pressure the game puts you under to get stuff done.
* Wind Waker breaks from some traditions with the sailing and the endgame, particularly in the GC version, is never fun to go through again.
* Twlight Princess \[my personal fav Zelda\] is maybe a decent pick since it's ""Ocarina of Time...but bigger"" but its tone and mood are a heavy shift from most other games in the seires, plus there's that intro...
* Skyward Sword has the advantage of it being first game in the timeline but the controls could be a stickler for some. HD Version does improve this.
* BotW is another decent pick, but doesn't play like any other 3D Game in the series.

The above is just my opinion btw.

zelda,[Other] What do you think of a Zelda game where Hyrule is portrayed as more inherently flawed and corrupt?,False,6,0,"Something that I've always thought would make a good Zelda game would be a game where Demise's hatred reincarnates not as a Gerudo, or demon... but as a member of the Hylian royal family, forcing the Link and Zelda of that game to work outside the system and not only save Hyrule... but fight against it to a degree. But something else has also come to mind. In a lot of modern media where heroes fight a villain who works in the system, they learn that the corruption in the system is a lot bigger then one person or a few greedy bigwigs. And we've seen so little of Hyrule's political machine in favor of monsters, dungeons, and adventure. But even those can thrive in the kinds of stories I'm talking about. 

So, what if there was a Zelda game, where we learn that Hyrule has a dark side to it? In the past, there has been the shadow temple, which was the royal family's torture chamber. And some not very good kings. But what if the next Zelda finds even more of that stuff? And while Link ans Zelda are on their adventure, they go through something similar to Ciri from *The Witcher*?

Heck, I get goosebumps just thinking about the horn solo playing the Legend of Zelda's main theme in the Skyward Sword staff roll song, and the whole arrangement's grandness really reflects -- and I kind of feel like it praises -- the adventure I finished.

But Breath of the Wild's credits, though... really disappointed me. There, the staff roll just plays the game's main theme and some of the game's town and character themes separately.. All the themes featured in the credit roll are very good (I'd say except for Urbosa's and Daruk's, which just feel like cutscene music), but there's no special effort put into it like I saw in Skyward Sword and Wind Waker, for example.",,5,,5,,public

Some argue the weapon durability is annoying, I never minded it. For most people who said botw is the best one, I asked them what ones they played and it's always just botw as the only one they played. It just isn't enough Zelda for my liking. I did really enjoy this one but it doesn't deserve this. There isn't the wonder of entering a dungeon and knowing your gonna get a whole new item to play with. Botw doesn't do that, there is no new item in every dungeon. Some people prefer this, me personally, I don't. The bosses are just uncreative and lazy. It's not like other bosses where they all are different creatures with specific weak points, attacks and background storeys. Like with volvagia being a dragon contained inside the volcano, phantom Ganon being a puppet created by ganondorf or the wild pig Ganon in twilight princess.

zelda,[TOTK] Vaati is the mysterious figure in the new teaser?,False,6,0,"&amp;#x200B;

Like most Zelda fans I have been wondering about the mystery figure shown in the newest teaser for Tears of the Kingdom. I at first assumed like many that it was the Goddess Hylia, but lately I think it may actually be the Wind Mage Vaati.

Some clues to it being Vaati are first and foremost the figure bares a strong resemblance to the first form of Vaati from the Minish Cap final battle.

Secondly we see an insignia on Links new sheild that is eerily close to the insignia carved on the wall at the sealing grounds that Vaati is usually imprisoned at.

Thirdly Vaati is a wind mage and he is basically always found and fought in the Palace of the Winds, a city that floats in the sky.

Fourthly the Minish Cap was a game directed by Fujibayashi and he is known to reuse characters and ideas from previous games of his.

Lastly it seems that Ganondorf is being resurrected in TOTK and Vaati has already done something very similar before in Four Swords Adventures.

Now, why Vaati is pairing up with Zelda in the artwork I have no idea, but I feel like there is a lot of compelling evidence that Vaati will appear in Tears of the Kingdom.",,8,,6,,public

zelda,[BotW] Regions of BOTW ranked,False,3,0,"Here is my ranking for the 15 regions in BOTW, let me know what you think of my list and what your list is in the comments!

1. Faron Region: Wow this region is awesome! Really picturesque and a great place to get a ton of food.
2. Hateno Region: It may look a little bland at first but it has everything I want in a region. A great Village. Some fun areas to traverse without being annoying and a Sheikah tower that isn't annoying to climb.
3.   Akkala Region: These next 3 could have been interchanged but I decided to give Akkala the bronze medal. Tarrey Town is definitely the highlight but aside from that it has a cool Autumnal aesthetic. 
4.  Hebra Region: I'm all for Snowy Regions and Hebra has a ton of it! It can be annoying to traverse the Mountains but it's still fun. Snowball Bowling also gets this region bonus points!
5. Wasteland Region: Gerudo Desert is extremely fun to run through with all the nooks and crannies. Gerudo Town is also one of my favourite settlements in the game. The Yiga Clan Hideout is also a nice feature.
6. Eldin Region: This region is pretty nice. Death Mountain is the main highlight here, but I also really like the Southern Mine. However, I find Goron City to not be that great in this game, imo it was done far better in OOT.
7. Lanayru Region: Contrasting Goron City, Zora's Domain is the bets it's ever been and looks beautiful. Getting there can be annoying but this is an overall good region. Just a shame there isn't much except Zora's Domain.
8. West Necluda: Kind of a meh region but hey it has Kakariko Village, my favourite village in the game. Duelling Peaks are also awesome! However, after starting the main quest I find there very little reason to revisit this region except to go to Kakariko.
9. Central Hyrule: This is decent. Hyrule Field can be both a blessing and a curse. One Half is tranquil and is no problem to get across, and the other half is swarming with guardians and other baddies. However, this can be a problem with travelling and I wish the enemies were more spread out.
10. Woodland Region: It's a bit of a mismatch but I kinda like it. Korok Forest is the highlight but apart from that I just find the whole thing to not really fit.
11. Tabantha Region: This region is very small compared to a lot of the others. Apart from Rito Village I find very little to do there.
12. Ridgeland Region: This one I just find to be a bit of a nothing region. Satori Mountain is the highlight but this region is just one that I run through and don't look back.
13. Lake Region: This region is quite boring but I do kinda like the North East of it which is filled with a dense Jungle, however, this is just the lead in to Faron and apart from that I find it to be really forgettable.
14. Great Plateau: It doesn't really do anything wrong, but I hate the tutorial of this game so that drags it down. 
15. Gerudo Region: Do I need to explain why this is last? Annoying to traverse, barely anything to do, and not that many shrines.

Twilit Parasite Diababa

Twilit Igniter Fyrus

Twilit Aquatic Morpheel

Twilit Fossil Stallord

Twilit Ice Mass Blizzeta

Twilit Arachnid Armogohma

Twilit Dragon Argorok

&amp;#x200B;

And then we have Zant, who's boss title is ""Usurper King Zant"". Not ""Twilit King Zant"". ""Usurper King Zant"". 

It's a pretty great break of convention, and it makes sense, because he'll never be ""Twilit King Zant"". Midna is the true leader of the Twili, Zant is just a pretender who used Ganondorf's power to usurp the throne and throw Midna out. ""Usurper King"" is just so much more appropriate.",,30,,869,,public

zelda,[ALL] Yet Another Zelda Timeline Concept,False,23,0,"Sorry if the image isn't pretty, I've reworked it a few times now.

Also, I hope I did the spoiler tagging and followed the rules correctly!

Some notes (spoilers ahead):
&gt;!-Technically, Triforce Heroes is officially placed after Link Between Worlds, and it can be there as well, but I just feel it works better after Spirit Tracks. Hytopia being a civilization near New Hyrule makes more sense to me.!&lt;
&gt;!-Majora's Mask, theoretically, would also have a split if we use my interpretation of bad endings being branches. I didn't include it because I couldn't fit it... even if I should have.!&lt;
&gt;!-Four Sword Adventures being a prequel to Link to the Past has a ton of evidence: it shows the origin of Ganondorf becoming ""Pig Wizard Ganon"" who steals a trident, introduces the concept of a Dark World, includes Maidens, and in the GBA Link to the Past, the Four Sword is present, broken into 4.!&lt;
&gt;!-The Broken Four Sword implies Ganon broke free of the seal and then sealed the Four Sword in the Dark World to avoid being sealed once more, unaware of the Master Sword.!&lt;
&gt;!-I made a note about this, but an argument CAN be made to move the ""Calamity Era"" events after Ganon is resurrected in Zelda 2's bad ending, but I personally prefer it to be where I have it.!&lt;
&gt;!-Final note... if you disagree, I would totally understand! The timeline doesn't really matter at the end of the day and is just fun to talk about.!&lt;

zelda,[WW] My experience playing Wind Waker was interesting,False,9,0,"This week I decided to finally play my first LoZ game. I’ve heard people praise this series for how good it is, so I wanted to see if I liked it by playing one of the games. After doing some quick Google searches, I found out this was the most beginner friendly LoZ, so I chose this one  to play. I got the game on my GameCube because I don’t own a WiiU. And I have to say, I love it.
The story and art design are very fun and I’m fond of the battling system. It’s just so cozy to play and I had an amazing time. But I will say the game became a lot more tedious in the second half. The constant back and forth and side quests were incredibly annoying and sort of ruined it for me. Outside of that though, this is an amazing game and it’s up there as one of my favorite games. I just wish the game stayed consistent in quality.
But should I have chosen a different LoZ for my first game, or did I choose the right game? Let me know.",,9,,9,,public
zelda,[ALL] Game Ideas That I Thought I Would Share,False,3,0,"* **Hyrule Warriors: Civil War**
   * Between the Minish Cap and Ocarina of Time
   * Plays out the Hylian Civil War
   * Can follow Link's dad or really anybody in the Hylian Army at the time
   * No reason to exist besides to tell a compelling story, scratch that Zelda Warriors itch, and do the impossible task of being a canon Hyrule Warriors game, I don't care if it has to end with you losing to do so
* **The Legend of Zelda: The Hero Shade** ([link to where I got the name from](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/knzek4/oc_i_made_a_game_logo_for_the_heros_shade_id_love/))
   * Between Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess
   * Game could have a mix of large battles like the Warriors games, an evolving and active semi-open world like Marvel's Spiderman, some optional content that hits the ""we know what this is, Link knows what this is, but that's not how it played out in this timeline"" chord, cutscenes and graphics that make the story beats hit like if it was a movie, idk it's just an idea at the end of the day
   * Puts Link with Malon at Lon Lon Ranch and makes them the founders of Ordon Village sometime later, Link keeps some of his Majora's Mask gear (namely the shields, swords, very few of the masks, and everything that ultimately ends up in the hands of the Hero of Twilight)
   * King doesn't immediately get after Ganondorf, but 'Dorf kills him anyway after growing impatient, basically destroys OoT's Hyrule, and forces the Hylians to move to what would become Hyrule in Twilight Princess
   * Zelda tries to convince Link to get back into the fight, he declines, but goes back to the ruins of the Temple of Time anyway to get the Master Sword and slay this son of a sand worm. Again.
   * Sages get awakened and bosses that were never killed in the Child Timeline get on steroids but ultimately go down anyway
   * Link still needs to die in battle for the Hero Shade to look how he does so the game can end either with Link getting ambushed while returning the Master Sword OR having the last mission be a Halo: Reach situation where the only possible ending is your own death.
   * Sages would be like an RPG party and be forced to step in once the finishing blow is dealt on Link, capturing and trying to kill Ganondorf themselves since their hero can't.
   * Maybe throw in a post credit scene of the Hero of Twilight calling out to the Hero of Time via the Song of Healing
* **The Legend of Zelda: Cascade of Tears**
   * Between Ocarina of Time &amp; The Wind Waker
   * No hero, just Ganondorf, Ganon, and nobody that can stop certain demise
   * Play as the Sages and Zelda in one big Halo: Reach situation, switching between them to prepare the Kingdom of Hyrule for the flood that is to come
   * Maybe do a mix of large Warriors battles, an evolving and active semi-open world that changes as you hit certain story triggers, some optional content that instead hits the ""we know what this is, and Link would know what this is, but Link is gone and nobody knows what this is"" chord, idk
   * Dungeons that are built into the environment but where each environment isn't solely there to function as a big dungeon (like literally 97% of Skyward Sword). Imagine a decaying Kokiri Forest as the main environment but the crumbling Forest Temple holds a secret doodad and you have to solve riddles, complete ""side-quests"", etc. to clear a path within those ruins to your secret doodad and maybe a fight a boss that plays out in the main environment... or something
   * At some point early on it starts sprinkling, then raining, and the last mission is to evacuate as many as possible to high ground, where Wind Waker's intro plays out after that
   * Can be a bonus game like how OoT on the Gamecube was a bonus game for pre-ordering the Wind Waker (or something, idk my parents didn't love me)
* **The Legend of Zelda: Warriors of Time** ***OR TLoZ: Hyrule Warriors (203X)***
   * Careful re-telling of some of the story of the original Hyrule Warriors, some original story mixed in, some of the pre-game info given in the original HW, and generally enough story and explanation to serve as the single event that unifies the three timelines and ultimately makes Breath of the Wild and everything after it possible
   * Maybe have it start as a game set in the Abandoned (Downfall Timeline for you non-believers) after Zelda II, with Hyrule as a kingdom on the doorstep of extinction and without any other option but to use the Triforce's power, the combination of the Master Sword and the Funky Blue Ocarina, or even just a direct intervention by the gods to collapse spacetime into one unified timeline again
   * Maybe have it start as a game set in the Adult Timeline and set up their comparatively more advanced technology to eventually become Sheikah technology once the surviving Sheikah from the Child and Abandoned timelines get their hands on it, with multiple strange evil entities cornering New Hyrule into doing such a risky move like violating the laws of physics
   * Have your sorceresses open portals and smash alternate realities together, have Toon Link ride Epona while chasing Manhandla through Faron Woods, have your out-of-the-park fun with it, but just make sure that it stays as canon as possible and paves the way for the amount of timeline-defying stuff that's seen in Breath of the Wild
* **Hyrule Warriors: Reforged**
   * Multiplayer-focused combat game that lets you play on a wide variety of battlefields in a wide variety of key points in time from the history of The Legend of Zelda in one unifying artstyle
   * Simplest way to imagine it is to picture the modes of Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017) with the weapon and character variety of the original Hyrule Warriors, music that's on-par with orchestrated versions of Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, the openness of Breath of the Wild, and hopefully online servers that aren't being run on Windows 98.

zelda,r/Zelda Meta Discussion - Rule 2: Mark Spoilers,False,6,0,"Hi r/Zelda,

To continue discussing the subreddit itself, with goals both to inform readers and to gather feedback, I intend to write up a series of weekly posts detailing each of the rules and their changes over the years. These will be added to the Meta Discussions collection, so you can opt-in to get notified for these posts if you ""follow"" the collection. With 13 rules, it should take a season to get through all of these.

---

**Rule 2 - Mark Spoilers** is our rule on spoilers. As listed in our [Short Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/about/rules/) and [Long Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules), this rules specifies that all Post Titles must be vague enough to not include spoilers, and specifies other details for how to handle marking spoilers in comments accordingly. This rule is also detailed further in a [dedicated wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/w/spoilerpolicy), which is updated around the release of new titles.

The core purpose of Marking Spoilers is to inform readers which posts contain them, so that we all can know whether a post will be relevant to our individual interests or contain possible spoilers before clicking or tapping into the post. In general, this usually is not too much of an issue, but there are heightened risks and concerns around the releases of new games, so we do tend to be stricter on this rule during those times.

Below is a timeline of when we updated our rule for Marking Spoilers. This rule dates back to the release of Skyward Sword for the Wii in 2011, but it has evolved with the releases of new games since then, especially Breath of the Wild in 2017. This rule is also generally intertwined with our rule on Title Tagging, so some of these posts were mentioned last week as well.

The rules as listed on the /about/rules page had been reordered earlier on June 23rd.

To note, we have never banned discussion of spoilers. We only remove posts that discuss spoilers if the post  is not properly marked for spoilers, or if the post title contains spoilers, or if the post breaks other rules.

On the other hand, we do issue bans for unmarked spoilers in two cases:

* For users that **intentionally** spoil any games for others, whether new or old - which falls under our rules on trolling. 

* During new releases, we make this stricter by issuing temporary bans to users that post unmarked spoilers, whether by accident or not. This is to prevent unmarked spoilers during the new release period.

---

So with the detailing of the history and reasons behind the rule listed out above, now I would like to ask for your thoughts and feedback regarding the rule. I will add current full-text copies of the rule in the comments below as well.

* Do you think any parts of the rule should be rephrased or clarified? 

* Do you think any components of the rule should be added, changed, or removed?

* How do you feel about spoilers for the upcoming *Tears of the Kingdom* release in May of next year?

* Generally, we consider details revealed in official trailers and officially released media from Nintendo to not be spoilers after a few days. This gives most users enough time to catch up on those trailers and media but does not place too much burden on those who wish to discuss it before release. This also gives us a good list of details that we can look to allow in titles once the game is out - i.e., anything not shown in trailers can be considered a starting point for spoilers during the first month or two of the game release.

* Leaks are a gray area, but will always be considered spoilers until after the game release period. We generally allow discussion of leaks, but we generally do not allow leaked materials to be hosted here as that can be a legal liability. For example, if a news blog publishes a leak or leaked details, then that can be linked and discussed here. But we do not allow users to publish leaks directly to r/Zelda, as that will usually run afoul our rules on piracy or trolling.",,4,,6,rito,public

zelda,"[OoT] gets better the more that you play it, and especially when you replay it as an adult",False,85,0,"
I first played OoT when I was about 13 on the 3DS. I remember enjoying it a lot, appreciating it for what it laid out for the series, and being really impressed by how well it held up to this day, but I wasn’t like floored by it. There was no arguing the soundtrack, the characters, the settings, the dungeons were all iconic, but having played a lot of the later titles first it felt a bit barebones. I was also 13 and didn’t give enough attention to it as it probably deserved; I basically speed ran through the temples.

I’ve been replaying it on the Switch and the game has just absolutely floored me. I went in this time knowing the basics, how to progress roughly, where to go, etc., and so spent a lot of time just fucking around and exploring. The amount of side content in this game that I just missed first time round is staggering. There are secrets literally everywhere. The world feels alive in a way that’s simply unbelievable for a game made when it was. Every single inch of it is so charming, every gameplay loop and area has so much thought out into it, the sense of progression from helpless kid to hero of Hyrule is pitch perfect.

And speaking of the kid to hero arc, playing again as an adult is like seeing the game with a whole new set of eyes. Underneath the kind of basic story is something really deep and profound, and it’s told mostly through gameplay. Namely, the loss of innocence that comes with becoming an adult. Until you get the master sword, all of Links adventures are kind of fairy tale like; he faces an obstacle, overcomes it, and moves on in the way a child just goes day to day, not worrying at the larger issues at play and failing to grasp what problems are a running theme in their own lives. Link might get the Kokiri’s Emerald, but the Deku Tree is dead. Dodongo’s Cavern might be open for business again, but the Gorons are sitting on top of a threat lurking right inside their mountain waiting to burst out. Jabu-Jabu and Princess Ruto might be saved, but the Zora’s home is soon about to be frozen over and Jabu-Jabu will vanish anyway.

Link, in his childhood naïveté, thinks he’s ‘fixing’ problems, but he’s merely applying bandages to bleeding wounds, all while following the exact path that Ganondorf has laid out for him and Zelda. It’s not until he becomes an adult, and finds the world isn’t what it seemed to be, and sees first hand the consequences of the events of his childhood, that it all becomes clear that this problem is far bigger than a fairy boy and a girl princess could ever have solved.

Link saves Hyrule, but he has to give up his childhood and his innocence to do it. I think the moment where you first leave the Temple of Time as an adult is one of the most effective moments in gaming history. The cheer and the fun and frivolity is over. Happy, bustling Castle Town is a ruin populated by the dead. This isn’t a fun little childhood fairy tale where the boy from the forest and the little princess overcome the big mean bad guy; the boy becomes an adult haunted by the past, the princess has to become a warrior and hide as her kingdom falls to ruins, and Ganondorf gets to live in ultimate power for years unchallenged. 

And even though Link returns to his child’s body, he’s no longer a child. He’s back in this happier world, but he knows the darkness that’s lurking under the surface, just waiting for a chance to strike and ruin everything. He’s been under the well. He’s seen castle town in ruins. He’s been horrified by the shadow temple. He’s watched Zora’s Domain freeze over, seen Death Mountain live up to his name, and in the very end he’s abandoned by his best friend, Navi, the one solid link to his childhood. The Kokiri stay childlike forever and are never without their fairies; Link is not a Kokiri, he’s no longer a child, and so Navi leaves him. He’s left there, alone, a child old before his time, who’s seen and sacrificed too much for a world that will never even know the best of it only exists because one child was forced to endure the worst it had to offer way too soon.",,23,,85,,public

zelda,[BotW][TotK][AoC] I really hope we get these two types of weapons from Age of Calamity in the Tears of the Kingdom,False,6,0,"When playing Botw and getting the Sheikah set, one thing that really dissapointed me was that there were no swords in the game that were short and could be held in reverse grip to complete the ninja look/theme.

However, in Age of Calamity, Impa's weapon seems to be a new type of weapon based on the icon right next to it's name. ([Kakariko Kodachi](https://imgur.com/a/C4PZEEN))

There's no weapon in botw of this type. And Impa [holds her kodachi in reverse grip](https://imgur.com/a/BXJEXIu) just like I was hoping Link could hold a short sword in Botw. So I hope that the Zelda team will add this type of short blade in Tears of the Kingdom.

Also, I think it would be cool too if they add the two blades types of weapons just like Sooga's [Swords of Ferocity](https://imgur.com/a/v51ZbtT) in Age of Calamity. Once again the icon next to it's name shows two swords and theirs no such weapons in Botw.",,1,,6,,public

I’ve recently decided that I’ve wanted to play all the games in timeline order (and after the split going defeated -&gt; adult era  -&gt; child era). 
I don’t have an issue with getting all the games as I either own them, can play them on the Switch’s NES/SNES emulators, or buying them on the 3DS &amp; Wii U Virtual Consoles before the eShops close. The only games I have issues acquiring are Four Swords and Four Swords adventures.
From my understanding, these games are multiplayer only anyways so even if I wanted to play them I wouldn’t be able to as I have no one to play with. Should I just skip them and watch playthroughs, or is it possible to emulate them in single player or is it not worth the hassle. Thanks for any help!!!",,6,,3,,public

By that I mean when Link fails in other games, evil has won definitely so time still goes on,  but you can't make games about it.

zelda,"[All] ... Could a Zelda Movie or Series come up, eventually?",False,5,0,"Okay, so, dunno if you guys know this, but Nintendo bought Dynamo Pictures and is renaming it Nintendo Pictures. They have the expressed objective of making movies based on their IPs.

Here's the thing though, and you guys are gonna get shocked, don't freak out, please...

The Legend of Zelda... is a Nintendo IP.

I know, shocking.

Sarcasm out of the way, THIS COULD BE BIG.

THIS COULD BE MASSIVE.

We could be about to get a Zelda movie, maybe a Zelda series.

LoZ had a funny series in the past, but we never got a movie. IMO, it'd be just golden not if we got a movie, but a series based on smaller adventures of a Link we already know, from a game that already exists.

If it were my choice, I'd bet in two possibilities: BotW/TotK Link or OoT/MM Link (in other words, the ""Hero of the Wilds"" or the ""Hero of Time"").

The first is a given: it's the most recent, with a story still in development, so it'd fit well in not only making an interesting and new story, but also marketing the next game or the ones after it, with this character. Imagine a mini-series, connecting BotW to TotK and explaining what happened in between those two events.

The other one is also easy to get: it's the most famous iteration of the character, only next to A Link to the Past's and Wind Waker's. The situation this character finds itself in is also kind of interesting: he's had two stories to his name while still being a kid, but the rest of his years are a complete mystery. It would be super fun to see a story after the events of Majora's Mask. He could've made his way back to Hyrule, so that could be a fun tale to be told, plus the new adventures he had back in his home and how he got to deal with the pressures of adulthood as a young kid.

Just some ideas thrown at the wall. I would like to know your opinions on the matter and maybe your own ideas for a movie or series. Things are looking bright, fellas",,27,,5,,public

Maybe Phantom Ganon is the closest we're ever gonna get to seeing what's underneath? Since Phantom Ganon is of course created in the image of the real Ganondorf, he's still got short legs, but not as stubby as normal Ganondorf's legs seem to be.

Have link do unique traversal puzzles throughout the twilight zones, possibly unlocking an item or two for Zelda that he can't use as the wolf. Or finding items like the bridge.

While Zelda does the more standard well Zelda stuff.  have moments were they meet up at the edges of the twilight, most likely for the musical moments Zelda is known for. Possibly the new way to wake up the lake spirit's. And restore the section for Zelda to traverse fully, have Zelda be the one to learn from skele link. While Midna gains more powers link can use via the fused shadow.

When an area is cleared of twilight link will be transported back to Hyrule castle, where a new area of the castle would be explorable. While zelda finds new area's covered in twilight to open up warp points for link to explore outside of castle. Have an end engagement take place in the castle that requires both characters to perform puzzles in castle that link couldn't do himself.

And an end fight where Zelda is riding wolf link into the final boss, using skills of both. Zelda with horseback melee combat, wolf links speed and Midna abilities, possibly introduced as part of the previous section.

Have link return as human at the end, possibly as bit of a final surprise to the villain who otherwise pulled a last minute gatcha on the two. Letting Zelda get the final blow via light arrow.  Of course, big story rewrites would be required, and progression would be a lot different. still mostly a linear game.",,0,,0,,public

I’ve been playing AoL on my top-loader with an OG Gold cart my friend loaned me. 

After 2 save fails powering down system and my progress getting lost, I kept the system on for a few days while I progressed through everything. 

I was fully leveled and headed to final palace until I experienced a very minor power surge that reset the game. (Lost no full power to anything in the house but storm glitched enough to reset NES and flashed house lights—no clocks or anything else reset.) 

Super pissed. Honestly, dismayed. I very quickly and angrily got back to full progress afterwards, but the system hates me at this point and I’m dealing with slight visual glitches leaving the game on for this long again. 

I’m sure it’s the ancient save tech on the cart, but is there anyway to thwart this in the future with this same cart? 

(I obviously know this progress is lost at this point unless I just beat the game with the slightly altered visuals which did reset to normal for me once already.)

Or is the only answer to buy a “new” cart where I hope I can actually save without leaving the system on for days? 

Would like to be able to fix and save to this old cart I borrowed.

Don't know why i decided to replay one if my least favorite Zelda games, but i'm glad I did. I had such a cool experience this time, completely changed how I see this game and how It scores amongs the others.

PH it's so much fun and creative. Sure, it has its flaws, cof cof...Ocean King Temple.
But it got some of the best puzzles, treasure hunting, and bosses in the whole franchise. 

After doing the ""push the block on button"" thing in almost every Zelda, having to draw the map of a whale-island and look for its body parts for treasure was just so refreshing. For the first time in a while, i just didn't know what to expect when it comes to puzzle solving.
I mean, like you have to draw, scream on the mic, blow candles, even close the DS. I'd never thought i would see those logical Truth Tellers and Liars riddle again after high school. That was wild.

zelda,"[LoZ] finished the original The Legend of Zelda for the first time, WOW!",False,21,0,"An hour ago, I've finally beaten the first LoZ for the first time and I must say, I'm amazed!

 Little premise: I'm 21 years old, so I never had a NES. My first Zelda game was SS on the Wii and since then I started playing random Zelda games for the consoles I had (Wii and 3DS), but lately I decided to play all the ones I'm missing (almost 15). 

And where to start if not from the first one?

Since this is a NES game, I was expecting something bare bone, antiquate, cryptic and extremely difficult, but what I found is a fantastic game that gave me the same feelings as the new ones.

I knew nothing about this game before playing it (not even what the game looked like) except the fact that reading the instruction manual was extremely recommanded.

 I was a bit disappointed by the overworld at first but, thanks to the manual, I found soon the first “level”  and if the overworld was disappointing,  the first level was a really nice surprise. 

After clearing the dungeon, my idea was of exploring the overworld using the map in the manual, and thanks to this I easily found the blue ring. 

After this, clearing the other dungeons was pretty easy until a problem appeared: where are the other dungeons? The map doesn't show them, it only contains hints for dungeons 7,8 and 9 (pretty obvious ones), but where are dungeons 5 and 6? Fortunately, an old man gave me the hint about the waterfall and the woman in the waterfall sent me directly to level 5.

The only issue left was finding dungeon 6 and this is when I found the greatest merit of this game: it's not cryptic at all! Even if there are secrets with no hints pointing to them, they're easy to find thanks to the map. 

The map is made to help you the most by showing all areas you never explored, the locations of the dungeon, the heart containers (except for the one hidden in the bushes) and everything else is obvious.

I've said enough good things about the game, so let's jump to the bad ones: Ganon is horrible, some secrets are unfindable without a guide and finally: the lack of a sign for bombable walls. 

But except for this, I really liked this game and I can't wait to jump in Zelda II tomorrow (another Zelda I know nothing about, but I've big expectations).",,3,,21,,public
zelda,"[OTHER] If Nintendo ever makes a TLOZ game with a stlye that a design more modern, or even futistic or sci-fi, what would the fans would think about it ? How you think might look like if it was a thing?",False,4,0,"After i played Breath of the Wild and saw all the advanced Sheika technology, i wondered 2 things: How a Zelda game with a more technology than magic and with another art style like sci-fi, futuristic or modern would look like, and if Nintendo ever did one, what would the fan base think when the entire franchise was in its majority fantasy with small exceptions of technology working because of magic.

About how it could look: in my opinion is hard to imagine how would look like, but something sure is: the story would be totaly different, maybe they live in a society where things like deitys magic and monsters are just tales, but discovering that those stories were real.

zelda,[Other] Could anyone help me out with tattoo ideas/drawing for my deceased father?,False,1,0,"Hey guys!

I’ll try to keep this short.

My father passed away 5 years ago. I (currently 23) grew up with playing Zelda. My first one was OoT on the GameCube and I have played almost all of the Zelda’s before and after that.

Well, it is almost as if it were supposed to be this way, but my father died by euthanasia on the day that Breath of the Wild was released. It’s insane.

I’d like to pay a tribute to my father by getting my first tattoo, which needs to be Zelda themed. I would really like black and white triforce, but then with the triforce of power fading into a bird flying away, since my father loved birds.

I was wondering if anyone could help me out with this?

Much appreciated.",,5,,1,,public

zelda,[WW] Unpopular Opinion: Wind Waker is the weakest 3D Zelda,False,0,0,"I used to regard Wind Waker highly but each time I replay it its flaws only become more and more obvious and make me question why it’s so highly praised. I want to clarify that I don’t think it’s a bad game. Far from it. The art style, music, story, and characters are all highlights of the series. In fact those elements are so good that I think they cause people to gloss over the actual gameplay, where I think it really suffers. Namely, the overworld and dungeon design is really lacking when compared to the other 3D games. 

Wind Waker is often cited as having the highest emphasis on exploration in the series outside of Breath of the Wild, and perhaps rightfully so. The world is fully seamless and after a certain point you can reach and chart any island you come across. The problem is I feel like that sense of exploration is mostly superficial. You can’t actually sail off of the main path at all until just before Forest Haven, and even then you can’t actually do anything on most islands you come across until you have the right item. This isn’t necessarily a problem in itself, but that kind of rigid linearity in a game that wears its supposed sense of exploration on its sleeve seems a bit misleading. With the way the game is structured technically games like Ocarina of Time and even Phantom Hourglass are less linear. But what really harms the game’s exploration IMO are the islands. The game has about 49 islands but so many of them are so tiny and uninteresting that think maybe a fraction of them were actually worthwhile. Most islands felt at best like some of the more interesting grottos in other 3D Zeldas and at worst like insignificant beta content, with the exceptions being the main quest islands and a select few side islands like the cabana (which was technically part of the main quest anyway). A few too many islands are justified only by the existence of a big octo or submarine nearby. The lack of interesting islands is only made worse by just how spread apart they all are. Having exactly one island on each square of the map just seems like a way to make the map seem bigger without backing up that size with an appropriate amount of content to make it feel dense. The Great Sea had a lot of potential, but it feels like it mostly went for quantity over quality. So the product is just a world that technically has a lot of content, but a lot of it is just filler, and it’s all spread so far apart that it inevitably ends up feeling sparse.

Wind Waker isn’t particularly known for its stellar dungeons so I guess this is a bit of low hanging fruit, but it’s true. The dungeons in this game are just really lacking, especially when compared to the other 3D games. It’s been said over and over, but they’re just way too simplistic. They’ll never ask you to think about the way forward, or how the dungeon connects together as a whole. If you get a small key it’s probably useful in the room right in front of you, and even if the way forward isn’t directly in front of you, the dungeon will probably loop you right to where you need to be. (Except for maybe the Wind Temple, but even then it’s nowhere near as complex as the Water Temple, Lakebed Temple, Sandship, or pretty much any dungeon in MM) This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the dungeons in this game have little else to really offer. They don’t really offer any unique theming, nor do they really offer interesting or difficult puzzles imo. The command melody is an interesting mechanic that some dungeons play with but it mostly just means you’ll be tediously playing it over and over again just to switch back and forth between characters. The only time I felt it was ever utilized well was in the Earth Temple, where the genuinely clever use of the mirror shield along with Medli made me forget just how many times I was playing the command melody. But one dungeon with actually good puzzle solving isn’t enough to save the game, especially when it only has six proper dungeons total. So in the end the game is lacking in both quantity and quality when it comes to dungeons.

TL;DR: Wind Waker is the weakest 3D Zelda IMO. It’s nowhere near as compelling an open world game as BotW and its a far weaker traditional 3D Zelda than OoT, MM, TP, or even SS. It might be a bit harsh, but it strikes me as the game that tried to be both but ended up doing neither particularly well.",,15,,0,,public

However, when I do get the time to play I seem to wander aimlessly, only coming across little bobokin (or whatever you call them) camps that are fairly featureless with maybe just a single chest if you're lucky. 

I've been to two towns so far where the story sort of directed you but now I'm left looking for random locations of photographs it seems if I want to progress the story.

zelda,[SS] A theory on the time travel of Skyward Sword,False,8,0,"This is a theory that has been floating around in my head for a while now, so I thought that I would post it and get some feedback.

The time travel in Skyward Sword always bothered me. When analyzed using common time travel mechanics or the established conventions of the Zelda series, it just didn't add up, and created loads of continuity issues. Well, I believe that I have the answer to the question of 'how does time travel work in Skyward Sword?'. I have several pieces of evidence to prove this, and intend to justify my theory based on my knowledge of the game. If there are any flaws to my theory and logic, please feel free to point them out. Any alternative explanations to this issue are also welcome!

To understand the time mechanics of Skyward Sword we must understand how the gates of time function. From what we can observe, when activated, the gates join up two points in time that appear to move simultaneously, allowing for travel to and from the past. This is pretty obvious, as otherwise we would have multiple Links all popping in and out at the same time. It also goes in line with the plot, as during the time in which Link is powering up the master sword in the present, Zelda and Impa in the past are traveling from the temple of time to the sealed temple. It is also clear that changes in the past produce changes in the present, as evidenced through Link planting the life tree seedling in the past and it then having grown and matured in the present. This discounts the form of time travel in which all the actions taken by time travelers already happened, leading to no change in the future. (But more on that later).

The issues arise when we begin considering other forms of time travel known throughout the Zelda series and fiction. The most common form of time travel, in which changes in the past produce changes in the present, doesn't work as if it was the case, several continuity issues would arise. Near the end of the game, Demise is killed by Link wishing on the triforce, and Zelda awakens from her slumber. Girahim then kidnaps her, returns to the past, and uses her to resurrect Demise, or revitalize him, since he technically isn't dead at that time. He is subsequently defeated and sealed in the Master sword by Link. This would then mean that he would have been dead the whole time and that the events of the game would have been entirely unnecessary, as Demise would have been dead. It creates a grandfather paradox. Of course, this theoretical scenario contradicts what we see at the end of the game, as Link, Zelda and Groose return to a world in which the events of the game have still transpired, and Demise was killed by the triforce wish.

One might try to explain this with an alternate timeline theory, suggesting that when Link killed Demise in the past he created an alternate timeline in which he was defeated long before the game begins. But Link and Zelda still return to their own present, the one in which most of the game takes place, and there is nothing to suggest that the gates of time allow for travel between alternate timelines. So what's the deal then?

My theory is an altered version of the second form of time travel I mentioned, the one in which changes in the past produce changes in the present. I believe that this is still the case. However, the mechanics around it are different. This idea revolves around a known mechanic of the gates of time, the alignment of past and present to run simultaneously. When there is an active time in existence, the past and the present begin to run simultaneously. It is my belief that due to this, changes in the past affect the present, but without changing the time in between them. Allow me to explain.

Picture this:a rock sits on a blank surface. In the present it is in one position. In the past it was a few meters to the left, and during the time in between it moved a few meters to the right to end up where it is presently. How it moved is of no consequence. Then, a gate of time is opened. A person, we will call them P, goes back in time and moves the rock from its original position in the past even further to the left. In the present, this would of course cause the rock to be moved further left. Yet the time in between these two points remains unchanged, the rock still having moved from its original position in the past to its original position in the present. If P were to have watched the rock for a while in the present, then this would not change that fact, they still would have watched it move. When P moves it in the past reality in the present is rewritten to account for the rock's movement, but the time in between doesn't change. Yet the past and the present remain changed. I hope that makes sense.

So how does this apply to Skyward Sword, and does it account for the time travel? To answer this question, we must look at all the main instances of time travel within the game. There are four of these instances in the main story of the game, so there isn't too much to work with.

1)Impa and Zelda to the past, using the gate at the temple of time. (Gate one)

2)Link to the past, after having activated gate two with the Master sword.

3)Link to the past with the fruit of life, in order to grow the tree of life and heal the Thunder Dragon. Using gate two of course.

4)Girahim, Zelda, Link and Groose to the past using gate two, in which the game's final battle takes place.

It is important to note that I have discounted any instances of traveling to the present from the past, as this has no consequence on the continuity of Skyward Sword, which is what is being discussed here.

**Instance one**

Early on in the game, Zelda and Impa travel through gate one and into the past. I won't explain the details of this event, since it is unnecessary. Go and watch a video on the story of Skyward Sword if you must. But it is the consequences of this event that are of concern. Zelda and Impa end up in the past, and gate one is destroyed by whatever Sheikah bomb Impa used. This is interesting, because it means that there are no active gates of time in the world, with gate two still being deactivated until Link remedies that. I believe that this causes the effects of the time travel to work differently, as the past and present are no longer aligned. The first form of time travel that I mentioned earlier (remember that I said it would later be relevant) is what I believe then occurs. This is supported by the fact that Zelda can be seen in her sealed crystal at the very beginning of the game, when you first descend to the surface, if you look through a crack in the back doors of the sealed temple. This obviously tells as that Zelda is therefore destined to go and seal herself in the crystal, and that doing this in the past does not change the present as it had already happened in the timeline nonetheless. I think that this is what happens when there are no active gates of time in existence, that the actions taken in the past become part of the timeline that the present results from.

**Instance two**

Later on, after having tempered the Master sword in the three sacred flames, Link uses it to activate gate two in the sealed temple. This then means that there is an active gate of time in existence, and that the previous form of time travel that I have established, the one in which actions in the past affect the present without changing the time in between, is reinstated. I won't explain the full detail of events, but Zelda ends up sealing herself in the crystal to maintain Demise's seal nonetheless. Considering the way in which the gates of time operate, aligning the past and present, this would be ineffective as Zelda would only appear in the crystal in the present, and the time in between would not have changed. This of course does not add up with what we literally see. However, it is most likely that in the original version of events that took place before Link activated gate two and returned to the past, that Zelda sealed herself in the crystal without their encounter taking place, and began her long slumber. As the time in between the past and the present does not change in my proposed form of time travel (which I will refer to as mechanic one, with the other that takes effect when no gates of time are active being mechanic two), the aforementioned problem created by mechanic one is nullified, as Zelda is maintaining the seal anyway.

**Instance three**

In instance three, Link returns to the past, having gathered the life tree seedling, in order to plant it in the past, grow a life tree, and harvest the life tree fruit in order to heal the Thunder Dragon. Mechanic one is in line with this, as planting the life tree seedling in the past would cause there to be a fully grown life tree in the present. Now, if changes to the past altered the entire timeline, then the tree would have always been there, which it is not. Groose also reacts to the tree's sudden appearance, suggesting that it appeared in the present when Link planted it in the past. This further supports my theory.

**Instance four**

Now here is where things start to get interesting. After having destroyed Demise in the present, Zelda is freed from her slumber but before they can all celebrate, Girahim kidnaps her and returns to the past in order to revitalize Demise whilst he is still alive. This of course eventually results in Demise's defeat. With mechanic one in play, we can conclude that there is no consequence to this, as Demise was already dead in the present, meaning that his death in the past does not produce any result. However, there are more important things to mention. Before returning to the present, Link plants the Master sword in the pedestal, putting it and Fi to rest. This of course would cause it to appear in the present, without any changes being made to the rest of the timeline in between, which does not mess with the game's established continuity. Now, there is the matter of Impa's, or should I say, Zelda's bracelet. Before returning to the present, Zelda gives Impa the bracelet. According to mechanic one, this would cause Impa to have it in the present, but before that we saw her with the bracelet when we first encountered her in the sealed temple after having first descended from Skyloft. So, what gives? Well, remember mechanic two, and how it came into effect after gate one was destroyed? I think that before sealing herself in the original timeline, before Link went to the past and changed it, that Zelda gave Impa the bracelet, same as we see in the cutscene before they return to the future in our version of events. So, like with Zelda's sealing of herself after the opening of gate two, this does not change anything. I admit, this is not guaranteed to have happened, but I realized this as a potential flaw whilst writing, and this is the only way that I can explain it. But there is not evidence against it happening either. With this explanation, my theory still works.

Once Zelda, Link and Groose return to the present, Impa in the past destroys gate two, eliminating the last gate of time from existence. I think that the effects of mechanic one's existence are not erased because of this, as they still happened whilst the gate was still active. But now that both gates are destroyed, time travel is no longer possible, meaning that no further explanations of continuity issues are required. Yay for me!

I have now provided all the evidence for my theory and why I believe that it explains the convoluted time travel in Skyward Sword. If you made it to the end of this post, then I congratulate you. It is very long, and I understand that it is quite a lot to explain time travel in one of the Zelda games, and that some might not be concerned with that. But I wanted to post it, to get it out of my system, and to potentially give any others an interesting read and an explanation for something that might have bugged them after having played Skyward Sword.

Thank you for reading, if you did. I hope my words make sense. feel free to comment for clarification, or to challenge my theory and maybe provide alternative arguments. As I said at the start, all are welcome!",,15,,8,,public

zelda,[LoZ] Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask conclusion,False,87,0,"Hey r/zelda,

1 year ago, I gave myself the challenge to 100% any of the mainline Zelda games and document it on reddit. Having beaten the first 4 games one year ago, after some time I decided to pick up the challenge again and start playing OoT and Majoras Mask.

I will jump straight to the rating and my own opinion :)

# The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

This game is really a masterpiece. It all started here, in my opinion. I would suggest every zelda interested person to 100% this game. The sound design really was the cherry on top. I really love playing games and just getting lost in the tunes. One of my favourites beeing the spirit temple and market music. It just slaps.

The game breaking the 2D barrier and dipping into the world of 3D is really unparalleled in my opinion.

The deeply involving storyline paired with the intuitive controls and an overall great experience makes this game one of the best if not the best game ever developed.

Rating: 100/100 a literal masterpiece

# The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask

The game has probably one of the hardest tasks ever given to a videogame: beeing the sucessor of OoT. The game still manages to be a great game. In my opinion, it is not equal to OoT. The game lacks ""pace"" at the start of the game. It starts off really slow. The 3-day schedule really inspired my creativity. Boundaries are set at the start of the game, and you have the rest of the game to get comfortable with it. I really loved exploring every nook and cranny to get information on new missions. Without the bombers notebook this game would be a nightmare.

The music is really well made. One of the best tracks is the astral observatory.

The game was hard at some places. I needed to google some clues in order to get the game at 100%.

Rating: 95/100 (-5 points for the lack of pace at the start of the game)

The next 2 games are the Oracle of ... games.

To be honest, I'm not that into these 2 games. I have absolutely no clue how they are. I have neither seen any gameplay nor played them myself. I only know that one is oriented about riddles and the other one is focused around combat.",,19,,87,,public

zelda,[ALL] Updating a chart for Getting into The Legend of Zelda - Which order do you suggest for the games?,False,30,0,"Check this out!: https://imgur.com/a/aqzTapx

Two of the [most frequent questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/faq) we get posted here to r/Zelda are:

* *Which game should I start with?*, and  
* *Which game should I play next?*

Generally speaking, the typical answers to this are to start with whichever game, and play whichever game you can get next, as most games can be played in any order. 

That said, there are some games that are more popular than others, and some games that do have spoilers for others, and some games that are more similar to each other. So for someone looking for a little more context in making their decisions, it is nice to have that information organized.

About five years ago, /u/Vernalddpdwie made a helpful chart to guide players on choosing which game to play and [posted that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/73rrzg/i_made_this_flowchart_on_getting_into_the/).

This weekend, I have taken a shot at updating that chart, including showing for which platforms each game has released.

Overall, I recommend starting with ALttP, OoT, LA, or BotW - all available on Switch! Then based on what you like or dislike about those, you can branch out to other games. 

What do you think? Do you have comments on the updated chart? I am still looking to add a few more lines of text to it, so I am open to suggestions on additions or edits.",,11,,30,rito,public
zelda,"[ALL] Zelda, Link, Ganondorf: Best design discussion",False,3,0,"So I figured I'd bring up this wonderful age old question. But I was wondering which games had the best designs for the main trio of Triforce owners. Purely from a visual standpoint this time instead of personality wise at least for the sake of this discussion.

- For Link my personal favorite is his Hyrule Warriors design. The shoulder guard, chain mail, and blue scarf are really fantastic additions to his usual attire and gives a good showcase of how this iteration of Link was already a career soldier before taking up the mantle of hero.
- For Zelda I actually have the hardest time choosing since she has a lot of interesting variations. In the end though I go for her Twilight Princess design. It's one of the forms that gives her that very commanding ruler presence about her for a mature yet regal presence you simply can't help but bend over in reverence.
- For Ganondorf once more I settle for his Hyrule Warriors design. Dude's huge, imposing, and has amazing hair to fit the ""desert warrior"" asthetic. His Dark Beast form was also pretty quality as well to help clinch it, though it wasn't the best of them.
- Finally as a bonus for Ganon I'd say OoT was probably his best incarnation. The combination of his huge form plus the lighting on the battlefield made him a truly terrifying sight to behold for a climactic final battle.
- (bonus) Hyrule Warriors also has my favorite version of Impa as well, just pure badass she was.

Anyways that's my favorites. Feel free to share yours in this thread that's most likely happened several times already. (though apparently not recently provided I was searching the right words)",,7,,3,,public

zelda,[WW] Am I just bad at this game?,False,21,0,"For some background, I bought Wind Waker HD in June 2020 and have been playing it extremely sporadically since; I picked it up for the first time in 6-12 months a couple nights ago. The Zelda games I’ve played through are SS, OoT 3D, TP HD,  and BoTW, in that order, and I am the type of player that likes to explore things that are not part of the main quest; I would never collect 900 korok seeds, but I did all 120 shrines and all of Trial of the Sword.

So in Wind Waker I was stuck on how to get into the Earth and Wind Temples. The red dragon boat told me that I should ask for help from “those in the seas nearby” or something like that, and I assumed that meant the people living on nearby islands, so I went to Windfall Island and of course found nothing to help me. I eventually gave up and consulted a guide, which said needed to shoot a cyclone guy to get fire and ice arrows and then use the arrows to access the fire and ice islands, and I previously had no idea any of those even existed, let alone where to find them. The only other time I’ve felt this confused at how I was supposed to figure out how to do something in a Zelda game was when I played OoT and had to look up how to get inside Jabu-Jabu’s belly. So naturally I was curious at how the game meant for players to figure it out, and I realized that I had never learned there were fish people literally in the sea around each island that I could talk to.  I’ve never figured out how the treasure maps work either, and according to the guide I am supposed to have 16 hearts by now but I only have 6 or 7. I’d heard Wind Waker was supposed to be one of the easier and more enjoyable games, but clearly I’ve been missing a lot of things while playing.

zelda,r/Zelda Meta Discussion - Rule 1: Title Tags and Post Flair,False,5,0,"Hi r/Zelda,

To continue discussing the subreddit itself, with goals both to inform readers and to gather feedback, I intend to write up a series of weekly posts detailing each of the rules and their changes over the years. These will be added to the Meta Discussions collection, so you can opt-in to get notified for these posts if you ""follow"" the collection. With 13 rules, it should take a season to get through all of these.

**Rule 1 - Title Tags and Post Flairs** is our rule on post topics and relevance. As listed in our [Short Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/about/rules/) and [Long Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules), this rules specifies that all Post Titles must begin with a Title Tag, and that Post Flair is required.

*Edit: I forgot to mention that this rule used to be listed as Rule 13 until the past couple months, when we re-ordered our rules. All other rules were moved one spot down on the list.*

# Title Tags

Most of our Title Tags come from the [commonly used abbreviations](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_Abbreviations) for the various entries in the Zelda Franchise, but we do have a few additional tags too. Sometimes, we allow specific temporary title tags for special events, [like [Place]](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/twet0x/place_for_a_moment_there_was_perfection_and_peace/).

The core purpose of Title Tagging is to inform readers which games the post is about, so that we all can know whether a post will be relevant to our individual interests or contain possible spoilers before clicking or tapping into the post. Some other features that Title Tagging provides us are:  

* Blocking an overwhelming majority of spammers,
* Allowing better searching and filtering of posts, especially with 3rd party tools,
* Encouraging users to read the rest of our rules before posting.

Below is a timeline of when we updated our rules for Title Tags over the years. More of the history on our Spoiler Policies and Fan Art rules will be the topic of later posts.

To summarize, we first began enforcing Title Tags on all post titles around March 28th, 2019 using Automoderator, though we had used similar required title tagging to help us enforce spoilers around the release of Breath of the Wild in March 2017 and around the release of Skyward Sword in November 2011.

Currently, Title Tags are enforced by Mod Tools Post Requirements. The main difference between Automod enforcement and Mod Tools enforcement is that Automod would tell you in detail only after you submit your post, and Mod Tools tells you without detail before you submit your post.

# Post Flair

We use post flair to categorize content types. We started out with just a few flairs and have added more over time. These flairs allow users to browse or search for specific types of content they are interested in, and they also work with old reddit search filters to allow users to block content they were uninterested in. 

Post Flairs also allow us moderators to set specific reminders for corresponding content types - art sources for fan art, text bodies for discussions, Merchandise on Mondays only, and more. Consistent post flair also helps both mods and users find previous posts to check for and reduce reposts.

Below is another timeline of updates to Post Flair:

2017.03.02 | [Imgur Screencap](http://i.imgur.com/mljzq3H.png) | We had added flairs for Screenshot and Question by March 2nd. We added Fan Art on March 20th and Video on March 22nd. We added flairs for Meme, Tattoo, and Tip sometime later.

Because it is not possible to change post titles after submission, sometimes we adjust post flairs to add critical information without removing a post - for example, to compensate for a misleading or inaccurate title, or to update on the status of something. This was more common in the earlier days of reddit than it is now though.

So with the detailing of the history and reasons behind the rule listed out above, now I would like to ask for your thoughts and feedback regarding the rule. I will add current full-text copies of the rule in the comments below as well.

* Do you think any parts of the rule should be rephrased or clarified? 

* Do you think any components of the rule should be added, changed, or removed?

Some new post flair categories we have in consideration:

* Breaking up **Highlight** into **Clip**, **Official Art**, and **Event**.
* Breaking up **Fan Content** into **Cosplay**, **Craft**, **Fangame**, and **Mockup**.",,1,,5,rito,public
zelda,[TP] My idea for a Twilight Princess sequel,False,0,0,"After Tears of The Kingdom is released, I really hope the next big Zelda game, is a direct sequel to Twlight Princess. Out of all of the mainline 3D Zeldas that deals with the typical ""stop Ganon from taking over Hyrule"" plot, TP is the only game in the series to not get a direct sequel, with the same incarnation of Link. Here are my ideas for a sequel.

• Ganon cannot return (he was killed in TP and is reincarnated in FSA)

• It doesn't take place in Hyrule

• It follows the same Link from TP and not a descendant (a la A Link Between Worlds)

Okay, so the game begins 1 month after TP. Link wants to find a way to reunite with Midna. Yes, it's sort of a retread on how OoT wanted to find Navi again. Anyways the story begins when Link chases an unknown figure and somehow ends up in another land via a portal. Eventually Link comes across a creature that he thought was Midna, but isn't. That creature becomes his partner for the game. I want there to be 6 dungeons, whereas TP had 8 (excluding Hyrule Castle) and MM only had 4. I also I want there to be these items called ""Mystery Orbs"" and they pretty much operate the same way as kinstone pieces from The Minish Cap. There are four types; red, blue, green, and yellow. The yellow ones progress the storyline and the rest are optional, for stuff like sidequests. I'm not sure who the villain will be. I want most of the game to keep the antagonist a secret and make the reveal shocking, when it finally comes time to reveal who he/she is. Anyways, does anyone want to contribute to my idea? Sure, it would be nice to see a BoTW3, but I don't want another one. I'm fine with two of those type of games. Funny how it took WW only 4-5 years to get a direct sequel, yet TP still doesn't have one, 16 years later.",,13,,0,,public

zelda,[TotK] [SS] The Forgotten Temple is the Isle of Song (the Thunderhead is back!),False,20,0,"This theory is not new; however, I believe it has been heavily overshadowed by the theory that the Forgotten Temple is the Temple of Hylia (from Skyward Sword). I can understand why this theory has become the universally accepted one, after all it's the most intuitive. The Forgotten Temple obviously dates back to the Era of the Sky, and the most important temple in SS is the Temple of Hylia.

The “biggest proof’ is the fact that both the Temple of Hylia and the Forgotten Temple possess the largest Goddess Statue we can find in Hyrule. The BotW statue is much smaller, though. Many argue that the reason why the size has changed so much is the different art style of the game. An absolutely valid reason. However, it loses a bit of value the moment you realize that in SS there is ANOTHER big Goddess Statue, and that is of the exact same size as the one in the Forgotten Temple. I'm talking about the statue on the Isle of Songs (located inside the Tower built on it). The statue in the Temple of Hylia is MASSIVE compared to the one in the Forgotten Temple, while the one on the Isle of Songs matches perfectly! Moreover, the statue of the Temple of Hylia is exposed outside the building (and it’s also taller than the temple itself), while the statue on the Isle of Songs is hidden inside the building (like the one in the Forgotten Temple). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Link's size compared to the Statues](https://preview.redd.it/gp2tmxrystp91.jpg?width=350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844d12feedf5093948f958c447d1e8a39dcbc371)

Finally, let's talk about its position. After the end of Skyward Sword, the Goddess Statues descended to Earth, returning to their positions in their original temples. So, looking at the BotW map we can see that if the Isle of Songs returned to Earth, it would land in the region of the Forgotten Temple. Considering that in SS we never explored that region of the Surface, there is no way to disprove that there was a temple underneath the Thunderhead. Most importantly, the Temple of Hylia should be located in the Great Plateau, since the Temple of Time IS the Temple of Hylia rebuilt from its ruins, so… again, it's obvious that the Forgotten Temple is something else entirely (a temple that was truly ""forgotten""...)

&amp;#x200B;

[Comparison of the maps](https://preview.redd.it/8u4qyxzyutp91.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0940622b6314e36009a38286627aa85a2226979f)

Now, let's talk about Tears of the Kingdom. We didn't get too much information about the map, however the official artwork revealed the appearance (or return) of a very interesting place. I'm talking about the Thunderhead! See how that cloud formation aligns perfectly with the castle and volcano, compared to the Skyward Sword map.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Thunderhead is back?](https://preview.redd.it/us9v9gduvtp91.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c97e7fbd267db0d686253176fd3e32b8b1db0469)

The Thunderhead seen in the TotK's artwork is located exactly above the Forgotten Temple!!! It's totally possible that the Goddess Statue is going back to the Sky, resulting in the formation of the legendary Thunderhead with its original purpose of protecting it.

zelda,"[TotK] Is the creature in the TotK trailer ""Pols"" after all this time?",False,1,0,"For younger and newer fans of the game, one of the original enemies in the series was called a ""Pols Voice.""

When checking out the new trailer, I drove myself crazy trying to figure out why the headdress or long weird ears seemed so familiar to me. Unfortunately I could not find a perfect match in the Zelda universe.

If I HAD to say this new being was related to any other being from the Zelda universe, my first guess was the Keaton race. They were present during The Minish Cap, and many theories surrounding the new game (and cut BotW content) relates to TMC, the Wind Tribe, the Minish, etc. So... *maybe*?

But I remembered that BotW was supposed to lean heavily on the very first game, so I checked out those enemies and remembered the bizarre unsolved mystery that is ""Pols Voice.""

zelda,[MM3D] My goal: beat every main series Zelda game before Tears of the Kingdom comes out. Sixth is Majora's Mask 3D!,False,12,0,"Before Breath of the Wild came out, I had the idea of playing through every Zelda game before it released in no particular order. It didn't go well. So now I'm trying it again, hopefully giving myself enough time to actually accomplish it, and with a bit more organization. I gave myself three rules to work with for the series:

Main series entries only. No CDI games, no Link's Crossbow Training, no Four Swords, no Triforce Heroes. The last two are being left out due to their multiplayer focus, Four Sword Adventures will remain because it works just fine for single player.

The games will be played in the order of the original release date. If the game has a remake or HD version, I will play that version.

Rank the games as I go so I can get a clear picture of how things stack up over time.

New Note: Oh crap, I have an actual deadline now.

Game #6: Majora's Mask 3D

Once again, this post came late because I was playing through Xenoblade Chronicles 3 for 6 weeks.  On the bright side, I beat Majora's Mask in only 2 weeks, so I made pretty good time!

Majora's Mask is a game of ups and downs for me.  The atmosphere of this game is phenomenal—the different reactions to the impending moon crash from all the characters made it interesting to talk to everybody you could find.  Also, the dungeons are top notch.  Stone Tower Temple has one of the coolest dungeon gimmicks in any Zelda game and the others are no slouch.  Just a shame there was only three of them!

Expanding on the masks from OoT was a lot of fun and there were a handful that were pretty useful.  The Bunny Hood probably got the most use, but I wanted to shout out the Blast Mask as a clever use of game design.  Start the 3-day cycle and out of bombs?  No problem, just put this mask on!  Of course, the three transformational masks were great and probably the most memorable thing about this game.  On the flip side, there were a ton of masks that did nothing except get me a heart piece or two and that's kind of boring.

Now, for the cons.  The big one for me is the bosses in this game.  Quite frankly, aside from the Goht fight that was a lot of fun, they were either lame or frustrating.  The remake's attempts to make the fights more interesting didn't really help.  Trying to corral Gyorg towards the mines was frustrating; meanwhile, somehow the Twinmold fight was far slower in the giant form than just with the bow (though I did waste a boulder on doing absolutely nothing).  Also of frustration were the events tied to beating the boss of an area.  Sure, being able to fight the bosses again *voluntarily* is cool, but needing to fight the same boss multiple times because you couldn't quite get all the goodies of that area before you ran out of time was annoying.  Thank God I didn't have to fight Twinmold a second time.

All in all, I guess my biggest takeaway from Majora's Mask is that I wish there were more of the things it did incredibly well at: the dungeons!  The side quests were neat, and the Bombers' Notebook did a great job of keeping track of them all, but it was more than half the content.  I still had a good time of course, it's just that Majora's Mask is a game leaving me wanting more.

Next up is Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.  I suppose I'll probably do one post for them combined, but rank them separately.  They're intertwined, but still different games after all.

zelda,[ALL] Are the top knights in Zelda games Lycanthropes?,False,11,0,"I've thought about this for about 5 minutes and would love to hear what everyone else's idea for it might be, but I think the best of the best regarding the knights in hyrule are actually lycanthropes, either in blood or bestowed it onto them. In TP we see link become a wolf, it is said that it is because he holds the triforce of courage and he didn't merely become a spirit in the twilight like the others did, but that's just the start of it. Later on we see the heroes shade which is canonically OOT link as a wolf, he can transform between each form at will, he is wearing armor similarly to a darknut, same height as well and they're all well versed in multiple fighting styles, switching to a faster paced style with quicker weapons when their armor is removed.

In wind waker the darknuts in that are humanoid but also canine, they wear a knights crest, one only given to someone who shows amazing ability and courage, we also see them fighting the moblins in hyrule castle, they're also well equipped with multiple fighting styles. So with all of that we can really see that wolf-like creatures can be tied to the royal family and are only seen among the top fighters.

But also there is another werewolf-like enemy we tend to see in zelda games, the wolfos, theyre enemies that are usually seen just wandering around, have no real agency and are hellbent on attacking anything it sees, it runs on all fours, attacks with fists blindly and acts more feral, theyre also the first enemies we see guarding the entrance to the forest temple, a place with ties to the royal family, could it just be that those were predicted to be top knights who couldn't handle being turned into a werewolf and lost their composure?

They also appear in random locations as well like grottos guarding nothing related to the royal family, and in MM theyre just random enemies that appear at night out of nowhere, so that could just be entirely unrelated and I'm thinking too much into it, but thinking too much into it is the fun part i say. Another kind of more reaching theory I have for why the darknuts in TP aren't canines is that they're husks possessed by ganon with no spirit, and as we can see with the heroes shade, the lingering spirit is what holds that ability, not the body itself, and we only ever see darknuts in old, abandoned or taken over places like the old temple of time, hyrule castle post-ganon, and the trial rooms in gerudo desert.

So what do you guys think? Why is there so much connection between werewolf/wolf-like entities when it comes to the best of the best for the royal families? Either way, all this really made me do was want an MM sequel that shows what link did between the events of MM and TP, how he learned the skills he did and what ultimately ended him and made him into what he became, I think there'd be a lot to show how he got there and his feelings of lingering regret that he felt from not being able to truly pass on his skills that he learned and had to give up, but I personally couldn't really see nintendo make such a game and have it be done in a satisfying way that ties both games together.

TLDR: The best knights in Zelda games have been related to wolves in some form. I spent only a few minutes thinking about it and I thought it was a fun speculation, some of the things I point to are not consistent between games and could just simply be a reach, but that's the fun of it to me, and I would like to hear what others think as well.",,3,,11,,public

zelda,[TotK] I hope there's a Post Game mode instead of NG+,False,9,0,"
Does anyone else wish that you could enjoy the world in a post ending peace instead of a hard restart/load previous save ending? I can see why they couldn't do that with BotW so easily but I really hope we can continue exploring and do fetch quests after the final event of the game with maybe some bonus quests and such. It would obviously have to not conflict with any DLC if they plan on doing any DLC. A Master Mode is also still welcomed.

Some post game ideas I had:

-Help rebuild towns/supply, material, fetch quest

-Companion quests ie. help npc's or even dogs traverse trails or gather ingredients, etc.

-Add post game rare materials to add unique properties to equipment/weapons

-Zelda follower.. she just follows you around with funny and informative commentary (like if you walk by some ruins, she gives a brief history of the place) and helps fight baddies (assuming the story allows this &gt;.&gt;)

-And maybe post DLC/Last DLC.. FIERCE DEITY MODE. Basically God mode with crazy skill sets and modifiers ie, smack bokoblins into the horizon, sunder enemies with bolts of lightning, levitation, etc. Just post game party mode basically.",,5,,9,,public

zelda,[BOTW] I finally found what I wanted BOTW to be!,False,1,0,"So I’ve often gotten into arguments here and across other forums about why the complete openness of BOTW just didn’t work for me. Mostly it’s related to the complete removal of the dungeons, and the feeling of more wandering than exploring. 

I picked up this random indie game the other day and it’s exactly what I wanted. It’s more Souls inspired but the map and exploration is the main focus of this post. There’s an absolutely massive open world at the center. It’s probably 90% the size of the BOTW map. It’s got puzzles, “shrines” with puzzles to reach the loot at the top, mini bosses akin to the Hynox fights, a giant castle in the distance, etc. Here’s the kicker…

It’s all gated! The central open world is surrounded by “closed” worlds you visit for story progression. They’re dungeons, but much larger. Each one takes about 2-3 hours to full explore and beat. You can initially explore only 25% of the open world until you complete the first closed world (it’s the only closed world available). This full exploration took about 10 hours. Once you get the sword and key you open another 25% of the open world and two new closed worlds. 

It’s also worth pointing out that these closed worlds are difficult. Your exploration of the open world prior to tackling them is incentivized because that’s where most of your character/weapon upgrades items are found. That’s exploration with a purpose, not just wandering. 

The game is Shattered: Tale of the Forgotten King if anyone wants to check it out. Do NOT pay $30 for it. It’s a $10-15 game for sure.",,11,,1,,public

zelda,[ToTK] Another Tears of the Kingdom Theory (Skyward Sword Spoilers),False,3,0,"So I had a thought. The Ouroboros in the title has to mean something. A lot of people think that the figure at the start of the trailer is the Goddess Hylia. People are also saying that there are a lot of references to Skyward Sword. My theory is that the just like how the battle between Ganondorf and Link is endless return (the meaning of Ouroboros) and the world of The Legend of Zelda undergoes the same process.

So at the beginning of SS it says ""One dark, fateful day, the earth cracked wide and malevolent forces rushed forth from the fissure."" The ground cracked and Hyrule castle rose from it. It also says ""The goddess gathered the surviving humans on an outcropping of earth. She sent it skyward, beyond the reach of the demonic hordes. Beyond even the clouds."" This outcropping could be made at the end of ToTK.

So if you haven't caught on yet I'm thinking that the end of ToTK is the beginning of SS. Also the master sword is broken so it might have all it's power drained from it and it might revert back to the goddess sword. So in conclusion my theory is that the ToTK is the last game in the timeline (not the last Legend of Zelda game) and at the same time is set before SS.

**Edit:** For those that don't like this theory, this does not mean they wont make anymore Zelda games. They can still put new games at any point in the timeline. The adult and child timeline still only have three games in them. ",,6,,3,,public

I understand written words don’t always carry the same context spoken words may, but I promise I say all of this in the best way possible: I’ve loved The Legend of Zelda as long as I can remember, and I will always love the series, but as I’ve grown older I’ve realized something that keeps sticking out to me and that confuses me, and that’s how Tetra’s design is treated in Wind Waker in regards to the color of her skin. When Tetra receives her role as Zelda, her skin color changes into a lighter tone, and I’ve read of people online talking about this and considering it racism from the developers, but I don’t want to immediately assume that’s the case because I don’t have enough information to create an educated thought. I am not light-skinned, but just because I love The Legend of Zelda does that mean Link, Zelda, or anyone else in the games has to have my color of skin as well or I’ll dismiss it as racism. I simply find Tetra’s case odd, but I’d like to read what you all have to say. If anyone read this, thank you so much.

[Edit] Okay so a lot of comments seem to mention canon and warriors not being part of Zelda so it doesn't count. Why is either of those things important here? Im merely talking about the almost near identical map APPEARING in 3 games (which it defenately does unless people have a really bad eye sight). Im sorry but why bring canon into this? And yes, I said ""...in Zelda..."" but that beggs the question why AoC isn't Zelda. Just because its officially a Warriors title and not A Zelda title doesn't change the fact that its all about BotW and its characters (unless, again, people have really bad eyesight). And yes I mentioned that I think it isn't important but some people like to zoom on evey single detail so I might as well point it out.

I indeed forgot about AlttP and AlbW with the ancient stone tablets which did feature the same map so I was simply wrong about it. Thats why I asked if it happened before in the first place. But now people are calling me out for purposefully being selective about which games to count and which not to count which litterally isn't my intention. I just forgot and I was wrong. 

And of course Hyrule is Hyrule and technacally its the same world because its the same timeline but as I said thats not important since that is not what I ment....

Sorry if yall think Im being rude. Thats not my intention. I just don't get why some people are adding (imo) unnecesary stuff to this and then be angry about it.",,297,,1292,,public

zelda,[TP] I Restarted Twilight Princess After 10+ Years...,False,21,0,"...And I love it. It's really, really cool. I'm barely an hour in but I feel immersed into the story, characters and setting. Ordon Village is a gorgeous jewel and feels intimate being surrounded by the trees and mountains on all sides. The game's artstyle is pretty to look at: Link's home is incredibly cozy with all the light rays piercing through the ceiling and windows. There are many books and pens as well meaning that Link likes to read and write. Perhaps Link wrote some of the books here, making stories for the children habiting the village. I loved hearing the sounds of the forest when you first go search for Epona, it feels peaceful and meditative.

I found a precious puppy in one of the villager's home who was very very happy to see me. The tail was wagging and it wanted to lick my face. Good god this is the best game ever, you can actually CARRY the puppy ! I put the dog on the table and looked in first person making its big snout fill up my screen. I pretended to kiss it on the snout then went away after struggling to step out the door. It was just so happy to see me.

I enjoyed exploring the village in search of rupees to buy the Slingshot. And what a powerful tool it is ! It just exploded a scarecrow's pumpkin head just as if I shot at it with a cannonball !

The combat seems a lot more focused on Swordplay than Breath of the Wild. I appreciate you can swing your sword in different directions in a smooth and epic way. The hits also feel powerful.

And god did they make Link handsome in this game. No wonder they keep him away from the big town, dude would be a superstar of handsomeness there and his ego would go through the roof.

If anything goes wrong, perhaps it's because the villain is jealous that Link is so pretty.

I am feeling just so hyped to go to Hyrule: the game does a great job hyping you up for the trip and that's where I will go soon. But I have the feeling it's not going to go so well...

So yeah, I really, really enjoy the beginning of Twilight Princess. Some people think it's too slow, but I feel like it's setting the story really well and I'm actually sad it may not go like this for longer...

The puzzles are perfectly balanced between fun and challenging and even though it has its flaws like the kinstone's mechanic (NPCs are too scatered through the map and that makes it difficult to find the correct ones) the game compensates them very well. I've only been playing this game for a day, but I played like, 4 hours non-stop, I felt almost addicted to it. I haven't felt this way since I played A Link Between Worlds many years ago, now I'm really optimistic about owning Link's Awakening for my Nintendo Switch.

zelda,[TotK] [BotW] Theory: Could the Leviathans within BotW hold larger significance in TotK?,False,57,0,"In BOTW, there exists gigantic skeletons of creatures referred to as ""Leviathans"". There are three leviathan skeletons in total, found at completely different areas in hyrule. There is one in Hebra, one in the Gerudo Desert, and one behind Death Mountain. So far, the only creatures who match their size are the three dragons. These dragons are able to be observed flying high above the clouds, and if you shoot any of them with arrows, they will make their way to a sort of portal high in the sky, after which they completely disappear.
Could this portal be one to the sky kingdom? Now, from the anatomy of the leviathans, we can assume that they were also capable of flight. This is a very important feature of the leviathans' anatomy that ties into this theory.

Why are these leviathans here? Where did they come from? And why are they so blatantly riddled across the map? (With the exception of the Hebra leviathan) And just how old are they exactly? This question has been raised many times throughout the lifespan of botw's theory community. From what we know, they were considered ancient well before the calamity.

After the new trailer we recently received during the nintendo direct, some have pointed out that there seems to be a sort of dragon-like creature hidden behind one of the sky islands, as we can see what appears to be a tail of sorts. Some have also pointed out that it doesn't seem to belong to any of the known dragons of hyrule. See where I'm going with this?

Some have theorized that we will be traveling back in time during the main story of TotK, to the great war thousands of years in the past. I am unsure if this is the case, but for the sake of this theory, I will consider this a possibility. If the sky Islands were a thing of the past, as many speculate, than could this dragon-esque creature be one of the leviathans? Could the leviathans have existed during this long-forgotten time? And if so, could the leviathans play a bigger role in the larger narrative? Perhaps they could play a similar role to the dragons in botw. But why, then, are they dead? Are they just normal creatures that existed alongside the ancient civilizations, unlike the dragons who represent the goddeses?",,10,,57,,public

Last year I made this West Necluda and Kakariko Village tour guide with the same design and writing style as the maps in Super Mario Odyssey, combining a bit what are, for me, the two most iconic games on Nintendo Switch. I have chosen the locations that are most representative of the region and passage areas to add more content in the central area. Probably for fun and to print it sometime I'll make maps of more regions.  By the way, the images are my own screenshots, some were difficult to take because Link is in the middle :)

zelda,"[WW] Wind Waker has one of the best art styles/atmospheres ever, in any game.",False,1264,0,"For some context, I'm not nostalgia blind for this game (I played the Wii U version only a few years ago when I was already a young adult) so I just want to eliminate that thought from people's mind.

God damn, something about this game's presentation just strike me some type of way. This game literally just feels like the happiest part of my childhood. It gives me the feeling of when I used to explore the massive woods that surrounded my small Pennsylvanian childhood home. The green leaves from the vegetation, the blue sky above dotted with clouds, and the somber pleasant breeze. Wind Waker just brings back all of those pure feelings that I had when I was a kid who'd go on imaginary adventures in the woods, swinging a big stick around like a sword.

Again, I never played this game when I was a kid, so these feelings don't come from association. The only other game I've ever vibed with on this level is Little Nightmares 2. Funnily enough, it's because that game made me feel things from my childhood too. I didn't have many friends when I was a little kid, so I did feel lonely and isolated a lot, and where I lived it stormed and rained constantly. Many days were overcast and dark. So whenever I play LN2 I get the feelings of calmness and somberness from my youth, and when I play the WW I feel my former upbeat happiness and sense of adventure.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way about Wind Waker, I know a lot of people still don't even like it's art style. But I just can't stop having these pure feelings of bliss whenever I play it.",,111,,1264,,public

zelda,[ALBW] What order do you do the dungeons in Link between Worlds?,False,11,0,"Personally, aLbW is my third favorite game in the franchise, and Definitely the most replayable/the one I replay the most, and I do so about once a year. I'm replaying it right now, and I always do the dungeons in almost the same order (because of items,) butI wanted to know if that was universal,or even if some people do different orders every time. So, what order do you do?

For me: Eastern Palace is required first, and then I don't really care between House of Gales and Tower of Hera, but typically do the House first because it's closer, and I want more hearts to fight Moldorm. Then Hyrule Castle obviously, and then in Lorule I always do Turtle Rock, Ice Ruins, Swamp Palace, Thieves' Town, Desert Palace, and then I again don't really care between Skull Woods and Dark Palace, though I typically do Skull Woods first because it's my least favorite of the Lorule Dungeons, so I don't want to end on it. Then Lorule Castle of course.

The reasoning is as follows; I never bother to get the Wooden Shield, because it burns up, so I prioritize getting the Hylian Shield.

The OOT and TP remakes seem to be the least changed from the original (excluding visuals).  Were these the least in need of improving?

Unpopular opinion, but I thought the Triforce fetchquest just about ruined the original WW, glad to see it neutered... this might be the biggest overall improvement IMO.  Majoras Mask 3D seems to improve on some of the more tedious, obnoxious parts of the original (ie, just waiting around for things to happen).

I haven’t played SSHD but if it improves the motion controls and cuts down on Fi’s unnecessary interruptions, it could really jump the game up considerably.

zelda,[all] (spoilers) ranking all the games i've played based on how dark they are.,False,2,0,"Games i've played but havent finished:

Wind waker


Games i have played and also finished:

Zelda 1

A link to the past

Link's awakening 2019

Ocarina of time

Breath of the wild


I also heard a few things about majora's so im gonna rank it too


7. Zelda 1.

 I chose this one because it has a a really shallow and cliché story. You could argue that only a few people existing living in caves and no towns are dark but its probably just limitations.


6. Wind waker.

 I've only just started the forest dungeon and its a bit dark with hyrule being flooded and aryll or whatever her name is being kidnapped but its nothing too extreme yet.  


5. Link's awakening.

 Its a hard decision between this and alttp but i went with this thanks all the wacky characters and enemies like tarin or that band of frogs.

Still, its quite a sad game if you think about marin and the others being just a dream. Its also relatable since everyone has had a dream where something amazing happened but they woke up and felt sad after.


4. Breath of the wild

The game is all about a silent apocalypse.

Humanity almost goes extinct during the calamity, and after 100 years, still just barely holding on. Small civilizations are few and far between. And nobody has hope for a bright future other than link and his allies. 

there are huge roboric spiders crawling around hyrule which have unmatched power and speed explained by npc's who somehow got away from one.

The memories show zelda's struggle with unlocking her power with no time to spare while she's getting progressively more frustrated as the calamity comes closer every day.

The champion descendants being the exact opposite of their ancestors shows how hopeless they are.

Zelda waiting for link for 100 years holding on with the last of her strength shows that the world is indeed on the edge of the cliff really close to ending.

But all this is HEAVILY balanced out by everithing else which places it only at 3th place






3. Ocarina of time

I think this game has either super dark or super light hearted aspects so its a bit more balanced out than number 3.

For the dark aspects:

Deku tree dies right at the the beginning and sends link, a young kid yet to see the world on a quest to save hyrule.

Uh.. i cant think of anything dark before adult link so ima just skip there.

First thing you see is castle town in ruins, with its only inhabitants being redeads: horrible looking zombies which have such a terrifying scream, that stops you from moving so they can get close and cling onto you doing go knows what.

Then you see lon lon ranch taken over by ingo who isnt a good guy i dont remember why exactly.

Fast forward to bottom of the well and shadow temple and you realize how fucked up the game is, when you encounter dead hand, who is a terrifying zombie like creature who grabs you with its hand to eat you.


I also wanna mention the dying soldier, the gorons in the fire temple held there to be eaten, and the fact that kokiri dies when leaving the forest.



2. A link to the past.

Many people overlook the game's atmosphere thanks to the cute pixelated graphics, but if you look past that its super dark. 

Right at the prologue the game shows you the SKELETON of the dead king sitting in his throne,

Your uncle dies in front of you after probably being stabbed

You meet a soldier who knows he is going to get mind controlled like the others and just waits peacefully

You are seen as a criminal in kakariko village and some people snitch on you when seeing you

Right after you finally get the master sword, ready to fight aghanihm, you go to the sanctuary after being told about shit going down you see the sage fucking dying right in front of you and zelda nowhere to be seen, kidnapped, and its all because you were so focused on getting the master sword that you failed to protect zelda.

After fighting aghanihm, you get your first taste of what the dark world really looks like, and its a bitter world where nobody is on your side, and people care about nothing else other than taking your money or killing you.

Oh, i havent even mentioned about flute kid and his father yet, Or the bully next to spectacle rock dark world

Another thing is the lack of the modern zelda atmosphere. The one where everyone is cheerful and help you as much as possible with the friebdly gorons and zoras and funny characters like the zora king or beedle, which means jts constant dark atmosphere.

The one thing that makes it significantly less dark is the ending where all the bad ganon has done is just deleted.


1. Majora's mask.

You saw this one coming and im not gonna get too deep in it, cuz you all know why its number one

THE FUCKING MOON IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE WORLD IN 3 DAYS!

yeah.. not only that but the characters..

On day one no one really cares about the moon.

On day two they start to notice it inching closer every second and get a bit concernded

In day 3 they panic. Knowing well that they will die that day

In the final hours they accept it. 
The people eho marry each other shows this really well.

There is also the deku butler's son, a happy kid turned into a mask by skull kid only leaving a lifeless shell of his former body.


Im way too fucking tired to make any more points.

Please share your tougths with me because im really curious about your rankings

zelda,"[ToTK] What if the Figure in the mural is one of, if not the 3 Golden Goddesses that predate Hylia?",False,3,0,"From the newest trailer, we see that the mysterious Dragon looking figure whose holding onto the 7 teardrop looking symbols seem to have enough power to be the main deciding factor that stopped a previous Calamity ages past, despite the fact that the power of Goddess Hylia, through Princess Zelda by proxy, would've been present to ideally combat the encroaching malice. Furthermore, additional scenes from the mural further depict how this mysterious figure is also capable of either sealing Ganondorf/lifting Zelda out of Malice, (and how princess Zelda of ages past seemed to have some sort of relationship with this figure) 

While previous incarnations of Zelda and Link were definitely able to fight off Ganon and his forces, the longstanding assumption was that just the powers of those two was enough to truly fight off Ganon and his forces. This is especially since Zelda is blessed with the powers of Goddess Hylia, and each Link is the reincarnation of the titular Hero who slew Demise, the root of Ganon's origins. However, there has never been a single Antagonist in the entire Zelda franchise of which Link and Zelda's combined capabilities, alongside the help of supporting characters, isn't enough to end any of Hyrule's threats. The fact that this strange figure not only seems to be the key to ending a calamity of ages past DESPITE the presence of Link, Zelda, and the unified military might of Hyrule at least seem to suggest that this individual's capabilities are more along the lines of an ancient being like the dragons. 

However, its unlikely that this muraled figure is one of the ancient dragons is unlikely for   
2 reasons. First, even the original dragons from Skyward Sword likely wouldn't have the power necessary to be as game-changing as the mysterious figure in the mural was during one of the ancient calamities. As seen in Skyward Sword, even though Lanayru, Faron and Eldin all had the agency to stop Ganon and to safeguard the lands of Hyrule, when push came to shove it ultimately still fell to either Link or Zelda to salvage the situation. And while we haven't seen these ancient dragons in action, its unlikely that they have the ability to deal Demise a serious blow anyways simply because they didn't do anything to stop Ganon even though they had access to an entire mining apparatus for timeshift stones within the Lanayru province. 

Lastly, the current iterations of dragons introduced in BOTW, Dinraal, Farosh, and Naydra, don't have the abilities to stop ganon either as they're implied to each be roughly equal in power and influence, but yet Ganon was able to fully corrupt Naydra with just his malice form. 

Thus, if even the oldest and arguably most powerful iteration of ancient beings across the Zelda timeline are unlikely to be able to deal a serious blow to Ganon, then I find it unlikely that this unknown figure in the murals can be anyone that was previously seen in the timeline. Instead, the only other contenders could be the golden goddesses who birthed the world. Not only would they be the only ones who could rather easly clap either Hylia or Demise, but they've also been the last resort for when the world goes to shit. For instance, prior to the events of windwaker, the goddesses directly intervened by flooding the world before Ganon could kill off Hyrule. Even though Hylia could've intervened directly, the fact that those 3 still did means that they are not beyond directy salvaging Hyrule's impending doom.",,0,,3,,public

zelda,[TotK] ganon being the ancient hero wouldnt make much sense,False,4,0,"Now ever since the tears of the kingdom new trailer (and the first gameplay one) people assumed long haired link would be the hero 10,000 years ago aka ganondorf would require a new seperate timeline created before OOT simply because the spirit of demise already inhabited ganondorf meanwhile the spirit of link posses a new hylian boy each time and its always a fair skinned (mostly) blonde hylian young adult who is the only person able to wield the master sword while demise took the rare gerudo male king that pops every 100 years 

Now for ganondorf to be the ancient hero he would need the master sword and as we see only the one who posses the spirit of the hero can wield the master swor meanwhile the incarnation of demise would get obliterated by the blade

So after this info there are 2 solutions and bith of them require a 4th timeline before oot, eithe A) in this world instead of the hero incarnating as a young hylian boy he for some reason chose the gerudo king meanwhile demise staying for thousands of years without a body becomes so angry he manifests malice and the calamity with his original body being sealed in the master sword but that doesnt explain the corpse we see in the first trailer unless its somehow twilight princess ganon, i believe eijy aunuma(i butchered his name ik) said that botw its way later in the timeline after it fused and now we have 2 ganondorfs, 1 is the twilight princess ganon since he is the only one of the 3 timelines who still had his body intact, and the ganondorf that is an incarnation of the hero 10k years ago",,7,,4,,public

zelda,[TotK] Theory Explaining Who The Long-Eared Deity Is That's Shown In The New TotK Trailer,False,0,0,"WARNING - Post Might Contain Possible Spoilers!!! 


The deity looking figure, shown in the newest TotK trailer, looks like a scaled up Minish/Picori character that is presented like a deity. In the Minish Cap the opening sequence tells the story of ""The Hero of Men"" where the Minish/Picori gift the Light Force and Picori Blade to that iteration of Link. The Wind Tribe also lived in the lands above Hyrule, as depicted in the Minish Cap as well. The BotW and TotK Game Director, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, was also the game director and writer for The Minish Cap.

In TotK, Link appears to repair the Master Sword with the help of the Light Force. The stone relief carving of Zelda and the deity figure making a circle with their hands show their connection of using the Light Force. Since the Picori and Zelda are both known wielders/users of the Light Force, it makes sense the game developers would create lore around this concept.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting TotK is the full story of The Hero of Men that the Minish Cap briefly mentions. I'm suggesting inspiration surrounding the lore about The Hero of Men heavily influenced the TotK's story. That, and I'm suggesting the long-eared deity is a depiction of a Picori/Minish deity, which Zelda and the deity share a connection via the Light Force.

Bonus Theory: The eye with three lashes pointing down, that is heavily depicted in TotK, is similar to the Sheikah eye symbol because the triangles on the Sheikah eye point up to purposely signal up to the lands above hyrule, and vice versa for the lands above Hyrule. I would guess this would be another way to depict the in-game historical importance of the two lands connection with each other.

So, there you have it. You now know who the deity is and why there seems to be an important connection between this Picori deity and Zelda.

zelda,[TotK] Theory about the green vials Link has holstered in the trailer,False,1,0,"When I first saw the green tubes Link has on his side in the new trailer and in the promotional art, I immediately thought it was some sort of canister for magic. In past games like in A Link Between World, Link has used magic similarly to how he uses stamina in Breath of the Wild, having a set amount that slowly refills naturally after being used. I assumed and theorized that you would start with a small amount of vials to fill with magic that could be used to cast spells from the arm Link gains. 

It would function similarly to the Sheikah Slate of Breath of the Wild, having functions set up at the beginning of the game that would be used throughout. We could upgrade or find these canisters by completing small dungeons like the spirit orbs in Breath of the Wild. They would function similarly to stamina vessels, where you have a certain amount you can use until you upgrade it, and they would refill over time after being used. That would function as a form of cooldown like the Sheikah Slate has. The arm might also contain the triforce, as seen with it glowing the same golden hue when casting the reverse time spell as the glowing orb in the Second Trailer when Link holds the Master Sword up to it. 

We know of town possible spells, one of which could be the reverse time ability, which could replace the Stasis rune. Instead of being able to stop and wind up objects, you can reverse their movements like seen in the second and third trailers. It would certainly make for some unique combat scenarios and solutions like seen in the second trailer and be used for unique movements and ways to get to the sky islands. 

The “morphing” ability shown in the second trailer could be some form of Revali’s Gale used in specific locations. It could be used to go through areas that would be otherwise unreachable, and you’d have to keep an eye out for them to find hidden treasure, like shown in the patent filed two years ago where Link can “morph” into small, self contained rooms with things inside. 

I’m not sure if I’m right but this seems pretty cool to me and I’d love to see it in the game. Maybe we’ll see some new spells in the next trailer!",,2,,1,,public

zelda,[TOTK] Why it's called Tears of the Kingdom...,False,0,0,"There is an unusual amount of confirmation-seeking and confusion around the title and what kind of ""tear"" we're talking about. Nintendo has just come out clarifying it's tears, like when you cry. That's obvious, they want to avoid spoilers.

I'm gonna lay out how the title makes sense to me and what I think they are going for here:

The main title of a Zelda game always represents the cornerstone of what Link will be doing in the game, and how it allows your adventure to progress. It used to be plot items but Breath of the Wild started this new era of Zelda, in which it's not plot items but the player's ability to navigate that steers the story's development. 

Breath of the Wild was a title implying the vast grasslands we would traverse and the ""breath of fresh air"" of being able to interact with that ""wild"" in order to make things happen, in order to gear up to save Hyrule. It also insinuated a world dominated by wildlife after an apocalypse. A kind of post-dystopic utopia of peace despite the lingering evils of Ganon.

As such, Tears of the Kingdom will be referring to similar things. It is...

* What world we are in

* What the main ""interaction"" will be

* What the backstory is

**The world we are in:**

It's Zelda-impact and there are floating islands in the sky. The map from Breath of the Wild has been ""teared"" (sorry) apart and made playable with a more vertical layout.

**What the main ""interaction"" will be:**

We've seen that there are these magical ponds that drop from the sky in reverse. We've seen Link arrive on a sky island by morphing through it like he's made of liquid. These are the physical ""tears"" of a crying Hyrule, to be a bit poetic. These are also tears of the Kingdom... Or *a* kingdom.

**What the story will be:**

Tears of the Kingdom begs a question: which kingdom? The new trailer showcased a mural that doesn't look artistically the same as the legend of 10.000 years ago, but it does evoke the exact same feeling. It also showed a wall with ancient looking figures and architecture we've not even seen anywhere in the first game.

Anytime I see the sky islands I get excited, but then the second they show old Hyrule from BOTW I go ""Oh."" It's the same land. I'm still trying to understand why after 6 years we aren't getting an entirely brand new world that we know nothing about. Why couldn't Link and Zelda have gone through a portal or something like Majora's Mask? I'm not satisfied with the idea that they are just adding on. I don't want BotW DLC. We can see big sky islands in the distance, but it's like one area, and the shot of Link on the glider shows a huge portion of the map. You can see the volcano, Hyrule castle, the mountains etc. 

Also, are we getting dungeons or not? I wish they would just say it one way or another. And if we are getting dungeons, are they going to be ""Hyrule Castle"" style, or are we getting something closer to the previous 3D games (OoT, MM, WW, TP, SS).

zelda,"[OoA] Oracle of Ages has the best time travel mechanic in the series, aka : Why it made Labrynna a fully fleshed out and wonderful location.",False,13,0,"Oracle of Ages is the puzzle counterpart to Seasons that focuses on time travel, and its been done fantastically in the game.

Many Zelda games use time travel but it hasn't been done to this extent in Oracle of Ages. In Ocarina of time or Skyward Sword there is time travel but it doesn't effect the current world that much, and its used sparingly with your actions in the past effecting the future.

But in Oracle of Ages time travel is everywhere, and the things you do in the past effects the present but in a larger scale. For example in Oracle of Ages if you push a rock in the past to change a body of waters trajectory, it will becomes a river in the present. In the mermaid dungeon the things you do in the past, such as blowing up walls and opening secret locations will allow those locations that weren't accessible in the present to be accessible. If you push seeds in the past and time travel into the present, it will become a vine that you can climb to get to different locations.

You see that the Sea of no return will erode and become a cemetery in the present.

When you arrive in Symmetry city it's been destroyed and uninhabited for hundred of years because of the destruction of the Tuni nut, by time traveling to the past and fixing the Tuni nut, Symmetry city is saved and in the present inhabited and flourishing.

Jabu Jabu is sick in the present because of the polluted water that Verans caused in the past, and you can find a Zora studying to learn why the water was so polluted in the present by the library. By Traveling back in time and cleaning the water, Jabu Jabu is healthy and the Zora that wanted the know why the waters were so polluted wouldn't be studying that, instead he would be studying history of his people.

You see Subrosians in the past if you play the Linked game being inspired by the Goron dance, hence the Subrosians dance was born.

You play the Tokay mini game in the past for the first time, and when you time travel to the present. You'll see that the Tokay don't play the game anymore, but instead they commemorate by turning the mini game room into a museum.

The Royal palace is nowhere to be seen in the present, and instead its flooded. Which is what I got when I bought the flute from the store. You're curious why the palace is gone in the present, and in the linked game it is revealed that Queen Ambi flooded her palace.

The islands in the south are shifting more to the east due to the tides, by time traveling you have to be cautious because of the shifting locations.

And the most confusing is definitely the Goron trading quest, which is on the same level as the Ocarina of time Song of Storms of time travel confusing.

The time travel mechanic made Labrynna an actual country for me, that had its own history, its own culture, and unique locations that changed in time.

Because of that I consider it in having the best time travel mechanics the series has ever done.",,0,,13,,public

I would say that it falls into a simmilar group alongside Zelda II, Oracles, and Sprit Tracks. All of them were new zelda games that were the second on their respective consoles.

Majora's Mask certainly stands out in a lot of other ways though. It has a central mechanic that I have never seen any other game try to mimic or replicate.

Theories aside, the way MM is presented and it's over all vibe just makes it feel like a nightmare or a fever dream of sorts. And there's something I kinda picked up on while playing it.

I find that the futher along in the game you get, you continue to learn more about the world and its NPCs. And you do your best to help them within the 3 days. But the more people you help the more it sinks in, its almost impossible to fix everything in one go.

(But im sure some kind of Speedrunner could do it)

I know mechanically you're not supposed to, you just need to save the 4 giants to stop the moon, but even then beating the game leaves a lot of those sidequets left undone.

zelda,[TotK] Theory: Both Long-Haired Figures in the New Mural are Most Likely Ganondorf and What This Could Mean,False,0,0,"Hello! I’ve been kicking around some theories about Tears of the Kingdom and thought I’d share here. Most notably I personally think there’s a major aspect of the new trailer a lot of people are misinterpreting. I’m new to posting here so apologies if any of this has already been brought up!

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve seen many assuming the long-haired figures in the mural are Zelda or some other princess (particularly the second profiled figure), but I'm personally convinced that both long-haired figures in the mural are Ganondorf. The “floating” figure’s position mirrors Ganondorf’s position in the first TotK teaser, and this is further supported by what appears to be malice visible beneath him in the mural just like it was in the first trailer (credit to Zeltik on youtube for bringing my attention to the malice). Twilight Princess spoiler: &gt;!The figure’s clothes also not only have similarities to Ganondorf’s in the first teaser, but also somewhat resemble his armor in Twilight Princess.!&lt; They have a head gem, a somewhat sinister-looking eye that appears closed or lifeless implying them to be sealed/in stasis, and long, thick, unkempt hair. Now if you compare the design of the floating figure with the profiled figure, the design of their clothes, their eye especially which is open and full of life in the profile one because they are awake/perhaps before they were sealed (and also resembles the sheikah symbol curiously or perhaps more accurately and appropriately the Yiga symbol since it is downturned), their hair, and their head gem all point to them being at the very least the same being. The only significant detail that might contradict them being Ganon is the pointy ear (which I believe is visible in both images but much more subtle in the ""floating"" one). The Wind Waker spoiler: &gt;!But we have seen Ganondorf with pointy ears before in The Wind Waker.!&lt; The Gerudo also have pointy ears in BotW. In the first ToTK teaser, Ganondorf's ears don't appear to be pointy, but all in all the mural could have just been an exaggerated depiction or a mistake on the in-universe artist's part (perhaps similar to the seemingly exaggerated joining hands in the profiled scene).  It's just everything else seems to more or less line up between the two figures and there’s so much evidence that it’s Ganondorf, especially taking into account how much of a central figure he’s been in the past trailers and conversations surrounding the game.

&amp;#x200B;

So with this in mind, ""Ganondorf"" in the image at the end of the new trailer seems to be clasping or joining hands with the deity. The ""tears"" above them also almost resemble a heart. Maybe the deity is some kind of Zonai deity or ruler? Perhaps Ganondorf made some kind of pact or alliance with the Zonai but later betrayed them, and the war depicted is an ancient war between Ganon's forces and the Zonai (as a side note the soldiers in the war image are curious-looking...they almost seem to resemble Link with his classic hat, but could also be seen as having inhuman heads with open mouths, which coupled with the deity's appearance might suggest the Zonai weren't exactly human in appearance). In the end maybe they managed to put Ganon in stasis but at a great cost, with perhaps most of their people being wiped out, leaving mostly ruins behind. The ""Kingdom"" in the title could be the Zonai kingdom, with ""Tears of the Kingdom"" representing the anguish and loss of a once great society in Hyrule (Note: I realize the idea of a kingdom existing within another kingdom might seem strange, but it is already essentially the case with the other peoples in or near Hyrule such as the Zora and Gerudo. It's also possible there was a period when the Zonai held power over Hyrule). Anyway, after these events, over the years Ganon's spirit/his malice has been ""leaking out"" and manifesting as Calamity Ganon, terrorizing Hyrule and trying to properly resurrect in a new body (BotW spoiler: &gt;!which was the final boss of BotW, him facing Link in an incomplete state according to the Hyrule Compendium entry in the game!&lt;). ...And now Zelda and Link accidentally remove the stasis and perhaps in the game we'll have to track down the Zonai's help somehow or use their ancient magic/abilities, similar to how the Sheikah helped Link in the first game.

&amp;#x200B;

Ganondorf could have made this alliance with the Zonai as king of the Gerudo, perhaps secretly desiring a power or some kind of magical ability that the Zonai possessed. Ganon and the Gerudo as allies or enemies would be further supported in the cave painting the first TotK trailer that seems to depict Ganondorf holding a trident aloft and leading other Gerudo into battle. BotW spoilers: &gt;!The Zonai are hinted to be a ""warlike tribe"" in BotW, so perhaps they saw benefit in allying with the powerful Gerudo warriors. To get a bit more out there, the Barbarian Helm supposedly belonging to the Zonai in BotW possesses long red hair, a common motif related to Ganon throughout the game, which could further suggest a connection between the Zonai, Ganon, and the Gerudo people.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

…As a final side note, and to get much more wildly into the realms of speculation, when rewatching the first TotK teaser and pausing right at the moment when there is a flash of light that illuminates a giant shadow of Ganon and the “hand” on the cavern wall, I noticed an odd shadow directly to the right of Ganondorf’s actual body. …It’s likely just more malice or maybe even a part of his body, but it seems oddly separate from both and it also could be seen as having long ears somewhat similar to the “deity” in the new trailer if looking very closely. With some imagination, it's possible to see this shadow as watching over Ganondorf's body. …I’m pretty sure this is absolutely nothing but thought I would mention it because who knows!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, just one aspect that I feel pretty strongly about and a theory I cooked up to go along with it! Thanks for taking the time to read if you did! Would love to hear anyone’s thoughts on this!",,0,,0,,public
zelda,"[TotK] [MC] Theory: The Zonai ""mysteriously disappeared"" by raising their tribe, and palace to the sky. They are serving their ""greater purpose"" by lowering back down and will be key in saving Hyrule. The Zonai are the Wind Tribe from MC",False,55,0,"Doing some digging for clues about the Zonai, I came across [this image](https://i.imgur.com/sWhVBPX.jpg) from 'The Minish Cap' which shows not only a Darknut clad in armour with the serpents/dragons that are associated with the Zonai, but a huge building in the background which is a dungeon called 'The Palace of Winds'. In digging around a little more, I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/o4kb8p/botw2_speculation_are_the_zonai_based_on_the_wind/) from a year ago which goes much more in depth about the [Wind Tribe](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Tribe) whom the palace belongs to. If you don't want to check it out, the Wind Tribe are people who once lived on the surface, but using magic they have ascended with their palace into the skies in order to protect it.

To strengthen the relationship between the Zonai and the Wind Tribe, the [Wind Tribe](https://i.imgur.com/KW5G3cE.png) uses the a [swirl](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/e/eb/TMC_Home_of_the_Wind_Tribe.png/revision/latest?cb=20200905200837&amp;format=original) and keeps the [Wind Element](https://i.imgur.com/R9ZFAYI.png) in their palace which is the same shape, much like the Zonai have on [their ruins](https://i.imgur.com/3Mxpouj.jpg). They also left [ruins](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Ruins#The_Minish_Cap) which are in the jungle area of the [Castor Wilds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/3/3b/TMC_Castor_Wilds.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20091204161738&amp;format=original). Possibly the most significant is the symbol on the center of [this platform](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/494636104612315146/1020323304243998740/TMC_Fortress_of_Winds_5.png.jpg) made by the Wind Tribe bears a tremendous resemblance to [the final shot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/494636104612315146/1019265881156636712/unknown.png) in the last trailer where two ""tears"" are in the same circle.

Some quotes from the Wind Tribe to further convince you:

&gt;"" *The people who built the Wind Ruins (Zonai ruins?). They now live above the clouds, suspended by their own magic ability to control the wind.* ""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*Although we are of the Wind Tribe, we, too, once lived on the surface. Once, the place you call the Wind Ruins was, to us, a home.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*Our tribe abandoned the place you call the* *Wind Ruins... With our magic, we moved our palace up into the skies. We are the* *Wind Tribe.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*In this tower dwell the people of the Wind Tribe. We left your surface world long ago to serve a greater duty. We now protect the gate to the Palace of Winds, where the Wind Element lies.*""

[This massive structure](https://i.imgur.com/uRDyYVE.png) that keeps appearing in the trailers I believe might have something to do with the Wind Tribe/Zonai. When the Zonai are said to have ""myseriously disappeared"" they might be referring to when the Wind Tribe took their palace and Tribe to the sky. So this structure might actually be the palace lower down closer to the ground so that they can *serve their greater duty*.

Their greater duty I believe might be watching over Hyrule and only intervening when they know that the world will end as we know it. We know they are able to know what is going on, on the surface since:

&gt;*""The leader of the Wind Tribe knows everything happening on the surface by listening to rumors carried by the wind.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;and ""*We have been watching, and we know all that happens on your surface world. We know a small boy collects* *elements* *to lift the curse from a princess. We know of* *Vaati* *and his evil acts... The winds tell us these things.*""

I also believe the islands that we see in the trailers aren't risen from the ground, but they actually are being lowered with the structure as well. It wouldn't make much sense to me if they were raised up, since the ruins on them aren't visible to us in BotW.

Oh, and all of them have red hair and are definitely all Groose's descendants.

Another theory that is definitely a stretch, but a fun one:

Artifacts of the Wind Tribe might be present in Skyward Sword as well. A robot called [Mazaal](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/a/af/TMC_Mazaal_Sprite.png/revision/latest?cb=20180927225542&amp;format=original) was created to defend the Fortress of Winds in 'The Minish Cap' so they were not only skilled with magic, but with technology as well. Mazaal look very much like [Gohdan](https://i.imgur.com/GD10jXn.jpg) as well, and has a design much more similar to the Zonai that we know from BotW. Keeping in mind the [colour of their clothing](https://i.imgur.com/KW5G3cE.png) and the colour of Mazaal, the Wind Tribe seems to like the colours red and blue. The ancient robots in Lanayru, for example the [Scrapper](https://i.imgur.com/rVSHisU.jpg), [Armos](https://i.imgur.com/tns3jN7.jpg) and [Beamos](https://i.imgur.com/hDzRCjv.jpg) have a similar colour scheme to them, so they might have been made by the Wind Tribe while they were living on the surface. The Beamos, though having many different iterations over all the games, looks quite similar to this concept art of a [Guardian Turret](https://i.imgur.com/WgWKM88.jpg) and [this Beamos](https://i.imgur.com/BpM1YBb.png) from TP might even have the Zonai swirl on around its head.

The Mining Facility in Lanayru is very different from what the Zonai design is in BotW, but since it's in the desert it's not unreasonable to think that it is just very deep underground due to the thousands of years being in a desert. Maybe due to more caves opening up in TotK this area might reveal itself again. As well, due to the facility mining [Timeshift Stones](https://i.imgur.com/1MKyu0e.png) which look extremely similar to these [Giant Columns](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/0/08/BotW_Giant_Column_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20210621071522) that the Guardians were said to have come out of, they might just be from extremely ancient Sheikah tech. Or what I would prefer: the Zonai, Wind Tribe and Sheikah are related.

zelda,[TotK] My Theory: The God of Darkness,False,2,0,"So, to start I'm calling this The God of Darkness theory, one because it matches, and because i needed a title for this post that wouldn't get flagged as repetitive.

First and foremost, if you haven't watched the trailer yet, here it is:  [(2) The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Coming May 12th, 2023 – Nintendo Switch - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SNF4M_v7wc&amp;ab_channel=Nintendo)   


The first thing to mention about this is lots of people have analyzed this trailer and many people have come up with all kinds of different theories. while lots of them feel like good explanations, they don't quite match up with the whole picture and they just don't feel right to me. two very good theories that I have seen are these two videos I'll link below, however they both end at the same point, and again I feel this is wrong. keep in mind this is nintendo and Zelda. there's usually a lot of unknowns surrounding these games, and despite all theories and the way something might look, the end result usually throws us all for a loop, and I don't expect this to be any different.

 [(2) The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Trailer Complete Analysis - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9SYtmE9UBU&amp;ab_channel=BanditGames)   


Now both these are really well put together theories and analysis videos, and I watch both of their content pretty regularly so I do like these people, but I can't help but feel they are going in the wrong direction with this. Now with the introduction out of the way, let's get into my theory.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The first thing of importance is the imagery of the Ouroboros. For those that don't know the Ouroboros is a symbolic meaning of Destruction and Re-creation, not rebirth, and not life and death, these are just different ways of interpreting that meaning, but for the sake of this theory, we're going to look at it in its flattest meaning and form: Destruction and Re-creation. There are a few key points in Nintendo's trailer (the first video I linked) and these are their timeframes numbered for ease of reference:

1 - 0:16 (The War)

2 - 0:30 (The Figure)

3 - 0:34 (The Sacrifice)

4 - 0:47 (BotW Link)

5 - 0:55 (Time Travel)

6 - 0:59 (TotK Link)

7 - 1:13 (The Ouroboros and the Main Image)

(lol i somehow came up with 7 key points, like the 7 sages lmao)

Okay so each of these key points show an important piece to this theory, the other stuff in the trailer is cool and important too, but these are the parts that are the most important. First let's talk about a few notable things about Zelda. We all know that since Skyward Swords retconning of the three goddesses and Hylia, we know that every Zelda is the reincarnation of Hylia. This means that Zelda in botw herself is Hylia (i know a lot of theories say otherwise but I'll address that later on), which means the figure at timeframe 2 isn't Hylia, because Hylia is already there in the form of Zelda. now that that's out of the way, let's get into the theory...

\- Starting with Timeframe 1, the big things of note are that Ganons forces are enshrouded in malice and are winning a battle against an unknown race of people. The second thing to note is that their design is that of the one in TotK, not BotW. This is important because this means a distinct change happens at one point or another, and it's happening again. We also know that creatures like Bokoblins and Moblins in Zelda exist without Ganon, but that these ones in BotW are made from or powered by Ganon's Malice, so it's possible that Ganon's presence and malice changes them somehow.

\- The Next thing to talk about is Timeframe 2: The Figure. This is an interesting image, as there are lots of different interpretations on the figure itself, and the depiction of this particular image of it. The first things to note is that it's holding these 7 orbs and is using them somehow. Now it's a popular theory that these are the 7 sages and I totally agree with that. We'll get back to this. The other thing is that there are clouds and streaks of some kind. There is a lot to unpack here, and I will, just got to unpack the rest so I can explain my theory.

\- Timeframe 3: The Sacrifice. We can see the figure of Zelda floating above a pool of malice that is rising towards her. There's a part here that no one else seemed to notice though, that someone has their arm outstretched towards her off to the very right, almost like they are the ones doing this, like a sacrifice.

\- In timeframe 4 we can see Link running to jump off a cliff (BotW Link), and in timeframe 6 we can see link climbing a tree root on one of the floating islands (TotK Link). we can also see BotW Link reverting time to reach one of the floating islands in timeframe 5. These are the most important information pieces in this video, as it means time travel is a for sure thing, and its affecting Link in odd ways as is evident by his hand and the state he's in.

\- The last piece of information is in Timeframe 7, where we see the logo for the game, the Ouroboros symbol, and The Figure and Zelda holding hands under an orb, almost like a ritual.

Okay, so now that we've established all the important information, let's get down to the theory. There is obviously a very heavy theme of Cycles what with the Ouroboros imagery all over the place, and Zelda and the strange figure, seeming to be two side of the same coin. Now A lot of people theorized that the strange figure is Goddess Hylia coming to help Zelda, or that Zelda is becoming Hylia, because that's been her journey, but the thing is, she already IS Hylia, and when she's reincarnated, she has to relearn how to use her powers just like a newborn baby learning to walk. It's safe to say that the rituals of Zelda going to each place and pleading with the goddess for wisdom, is just that, a ritual and it holds no other meaning, its simply how the people of this world have come to interpret it over the ages, and as stories passed down overtime often do, the story gets muddled and altered. Yes, there is in-fact the thing of praying to the goddess statue as a game mechanic and her speaking back as Goddess Hylia, but this could just be a remanence of Hylia's being leftover. Afterall it's very common in Japanese culture (folklore? sorry I don't know the right way to say it) that deity's have shrines and if one prays at a deity's shrine, it gives them life more or less, and the more that people pray to them, the more ""real"" they essentially become. it could be that this is what's happening, so it's not really Hylia herself, but the worlds interpretation of her given life. this also would explain the dark statue in Hatano, the one that people hadn't prayed to in a long time before you come around. The reason this statue is the way it is, is likely due to how the people of Hatano see it, this ominous devilish misinterpretation of their beloved Goddess Hylia, hence why its malevolent and corrupt. nobody prays to it, and those that do, pray bad things. So, this means that Zelda is in fact Hylia, which means this other figure in the trailer is NOT Hylia.

The Ouroboros is a prominent Symbol in this game and its meaning is, in most direct terms, Destruction and Re-creation. This means that this game is heavily themed around the idea of a never-ending cycle of destruction and re-creation. It's fair to say that in Timeframe 7 when we see the figure and Zelda holding hands, that this is not only what the Ouroboros is referring to, but it's also a Ying and Yang, life and death, light and darkness. If we know that Zelda in this depiction is actually Goddess Hylia, then we know that Hylia is the light, and that means this other figure, is the dark.

I think at this point it's quite clear where I'm heading with this. The Figure seen in timeframe 2 isn't Hylia, it's a new deity that we haven't ever seen, or rather it's a deity that's been there the whole time, one that is a bringer of darkness. before you shout at me in the comments, I can in fact back this theory up.

If you look at timeframe 2, it's clear that The Figure is doing something magical and is using the seven orbs to do it. I was vague on my wording of this image before because there are two ways of interpreting this image. The first way you can interpret it is that this creature is using the 7 sages to part the dark clouds and shine light down onto Hyrule, or you can interpret it as this evil entity has captured the seven sage, and is bringing dark clouds, rain, and storms onto Hyrule. To further support this idea, when is the last time you saw the 7 sages? I can't remember them being present in BotW at all, nor any mention at all of them, which is quite odd considering there's always at least SOME mention of them in every main entry 3D Zelda game, hell even Windwaker  and twilight princess speak of them, but here, they've been absent. the Triforce itself has as well, but we know that Zelda uses the Triforce's power so maybe that's okay, but we know the sages are for sure absent and this dark entity having them isn't good.

Another thing to back this up is in timeframe 3. This is obviously the scene in the first trailer where Ganondorf is sacrificed, however in this picture we see that its Zelda instead. The thing is, the one whose sacrificing her is The Figure from timeframe 2, this dark entity sacrificed, not Ganondorf, but goddess Hylia herself to the malice of Ganon, plunging this world into darkness for all of eternity.

Now I know that sounds weird but hear me out. After the events of Ocarina of time, link returned to the past to go find Navi, and because of this he was missing in the adult timeline, so when Ganon attacked again in the Windwaker, there was no one to stop him and Hyrule was flooded. in this game a young boy had to rise to the occasion to become the new hero because no other hero existed in that timeline anymore. This is very similar to that, the goddess Hylia is being kept in a state of undead, so she's both dead, and alive, meaning she'd be able to reincarnate, but a lifeless vessel still remains. This is why it's so hard for this version of Hylia to reobtain her powers, she essentially is calling upon something that doesn't exist, similar to what Windwaker link had to do. but if that's the case then why does she look like Ganondorf and not Zelda?

I have a theory about this as well, and I feel like it fits it all perfectly. We know that because of timeframes 4, 5, and 6, that link does some time traveling, and it begins to affect him in strange ways. there's one piece of the 10,000-year-old legend in BotW that no one was ever able to make sense of, and its who this man is in place of link?  


[guy on the right](https://preview.redd.it/aoa64bbpbao91.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08235864dde435ce7422988074e2e26ae493628c)

He wields the master sword and wears the champions clothing, yet his hair isn't golden, its red, and he has a boar like face and teeth... So, it can't be link right?? I think it's possible that whatever the time manipulation does, these 'Tears"" of the kingdom, affect him, transform him into a grotesque monster akin to those born from the malice, and it's entirely possible that this sacrificial ritual has been doing the exact same thing to goddess Hylia for all these years, turning her into a grotesque monster (sorry gdorf). 

If you all remember in the original TotK trailer, reversing the audio gave a message. It's still not entirely clear, but lots of people think it sounds like ""please help"" and ""please find my body"" etc.. this fits so well with Hylia being imprisoned in a timeless death by this dark deity, that its disturbing.

TLDR: in short, this figure is the God of Darkness, and the person being held in a state of undead is the Goddess Hylia herself, a previous version of Zelda from 10,000 years ago. This is a game about a never-ending cycle of the destruction and recreation of both Hyrule, link, and the goddess Hylia. If I'm right, this is gonna be one dark game.",,4,,2,,public

zelda,[TotK] What influence do you think Link's new design has in Tears of the Kingdome???,False,0,0,"We were all surprised to see Link's new look in the second trailer of the game, which is a radical departure from the look we were more used to like his iconic green tunic or even the blue ropes of Botw.

I personally liked it a lot as it gives him a much more ancient or archaic look, which may be related to theories about Hyrule's past. but what I wanted to discuss is, what real world influence do you think inspired his new costume and design? for me there is a strong reminiscence of Greco-Roman culture, both for the sandals and the toga that covers half of Link's chest. but, I also feel that there may be influence from barbarian peoples of eurasia from that time period, mainly the Scythians and Thracians, this is also because of the theories that unite this new designe to the ancient Zonai tribe, who were characterized by their love for war and battle tattoos on their bodies as the lore in the game and farore ruins says.

But i would like to know your opinion, what influence you think that his new design has? im using some fanarts and artwork so you can see it.

[ I put these 3 fanarts here as an example, \(and also because they are amazing\) we can see the best of the new design, a loose golden hair, a rustic looking belt, a white toga that only covers half of the chest together with a green tunic in the same position. also, the third fanart presents link with boots that look like they are made of animal skin and fur, more similar to the image below of the Scythians. ](https://preview.redd.it/85rh4z0dlbo91.jpg?width=2886&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=532725f0316571d8b847b5eb1010f89e158c9c39)

[ this illustrations is of an ancient Greek citizen or traveler, as you can see there is a predominance of light clothing and the toga or male skirt instead of pants. ](https://preview.redd.it/1prn2biglbo91.jpg?width=320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=588b6638cb9ea2bc2fdf6b779be5f92168ca8cdb)

[ finally, we have these two images, the first one represents the Eurasian horde of the ancient Scythians, you can see a more crude style to design the clothes, more prepared for the temperatures of the steppes and that gives the idea of fierce warriors, besides, there are also the tattoos that the rider has on his arms, similar to those that Link has on his new arm ](https://preview.redd.it/uxnt5l0klbo91.jpg?width=3780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c7ad1f8dfa46e47da4413e9173ddde3a206dd4b)",,7,,0,,public
zelda,[TotK] Theory: Midna is the figure depicted in the mural,False,0,0,"This has probably been thrown around before, but I want to approach this from a different angle. 

My theory is based on these observations:

1. The figure has long pointed ears
2. Spiral motifs, most notably present in the fused shadow, appear throughout the artwork 
3. The curls atop the fused shadow look reminiscent of the two magatama-like “tears” displayed in the mural.
4. In said panel, who we presume to be Zelda is linking hands with the figure in a circle. This pseudo-ouroborous is a common symbol throughout the trailer. We can also see this depicted with two snakes on the door that link opens in the trailer. Oh, and the logo.

Where else have we seen two snakes?

• This will be a darker Zelda title

• Different items/runes (the arm seems to be the new rune system)

• Time manipulation

• Companion character (possibly in the form of the arm, not confirmed yet)

• Floating Islands / Sky dimension 

• Jumping off into the sky

• Landing on some form of bird (the robot/drone in the TOTK teaser looks like a replacement/call back for Loftwings)

• Upgrading the Master Sword (tbf, I can't remember if we've ever had to repair it, but that can just be TOTK's way/version of upgrading it)

• An underground area

• Some of the abilities (runes) are obviously unique

• Link's Arm and outfit (aesthetically unique)

• Finally learning more about the Zonai

• Some new enemy designs

• Other small/specific aesthetic changes

zelda,[ALL] How would you feel about open world Zelda taking inspiration from Super Mario 64's castle?,False,0,0,"If there is one thing Zelda has been good at doing ever Link to the Past it is to take the formula and add gimmicks on top of it. LttP had the light/dark worlds, Majora's Mask had time travel, Wind Waker had sea travel. I feel these are probably the more obvious gimmicks. Now that BotW has laid the foundation for a new formula, I'm curious what else can we do with it?

One idea with a lot of potential is to keep Hyrule Castle or some other large structure as a central dungeon and, instead of allowing you to enter it as soon as possible, to gate off its doors until you have a certain amount of... something. Could be the equivalent of spirit orbs, the equivalent of Korok seeds, etc. Who knows? Although for simplicity's sake, and for the sake of the Mario 64 analogy, I'll use spirit orbs from BotW because Nintendo seems to like having 120 of something. 

What if you begin in the castle for some reason, yet most of the doors are locked? Just like in Mario 64, you would need to collect a certain amount of orbs to unlock doors. Maybe the gate is free, then the first door you find is unlocked with 4 orbs. You'd find something in here, maybe an item, maybe an NPC. Then, that's it and you can't explore any more of the castle. So, you go back out to the world and explore.

The idea would be similar to the Temple of the Ocean King where you return multiple times throughout the game. While you might be rewarded short-term with some orbs or seeds, you will also be rewarded long-term by exploring more of the castle. Maybe it's a huge interconnected dungeon and, because you can open just one door at a time, you can't explore all of its content on one playthrough. It could be one of those things where players discuss among themselves the different choices they made. Maybe you chose the door leading to a mini-dungeon all about the Gust Bellows while your friend chose a sweaty combat trial against some Darknuts.

Every path would eventually lead to Ganon's door which, to continue the Mario 64 analogy, would be opened with 70 orbs. Experiencing 60%-ish percent of this game's content sounds fair enough. You'd explore all these different caves, shrines, dungeons, etc, and then you'd have enough orbs to finish the game.

I think, more than my fascination with the idea of large dungeons like Temple of the Ocean King, this would provide some much needed extrinsic motivation for those of us who felt it was lacking in BotW. You'd always be wondering throughout the game, ""What am I going to see in Hyrule Castle next?""",,3,,0,,public

Since I barely use my switch a ton I didn't need the oled update (wanted it but didn't need it so didn't buy it so I could buy other things I needed more) but if Nintendo  DID make a switch oled bundle for the new zelda that would be an instant  buy.

zelda,[TotK] How the title and logo might be a spoiler,False,10,0,"A theory, but I can see how the title and logo could be a spoiler. The logo is an ouroboros with two heads or two ouroboros'. It's typically a symbol for the cycle of life and death. I noticed that when the logo was revealed, the ouroboros was rotating counter-clockwise. Maybe the game is also about turning back time since we see some time inversion in the trailers. The title has the word ""tears,"" which might refer to the kingdom being physically torn apart and tears from people crying. It might be a spoiler since there has to be something that might cause a whole kingdom to cry. Something so bad and irreversible, like death, that turning back time is the only way to fix this event.

zelda,r/Zelda Meta Discussion - Rule 3: Art Sources Required,False,6,0,"Hi r/Zelda,

To continue discussing the subreddit itself, with goals both to inform readers and to gather feedback, I intend to write up a series of weekly posts detailing each of the rules and their changes over the years. These will be added to the Meta Discussions collection, so you can opt-in to get notified for these posts if you ""follow"" the collection. With 13 rules, it should take a season to get through all of these.

---

**Rule 3 - Art Sources Required** is our rule on Fan Art and our requirements for properly sourcing them. As listed in our [Short Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/about/rules/) and [Long Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules), this rule specifies that all Fan Art Post Titles must include attribution to the artist by name or claim, and if the post is not OC or does not include a direct link itself, then a comment containing a direct link to the original art page is required. 

The core purpose of Art Sources Required is to inform readers about who is the original author and to whom the credit or further attention should be directed. In general, this rule is well-followed except by spammers and by users who need reminded to read the rules - we are a lot more lenient with the latter than the former.

Below is a timeline of when we updated our rule for Art Sources Required. This rule dates back to the beginning of the subreddit, but it has changed a few times since then, especially as the features and nature of reddit has changed over the years.

2022.09.13 | [SideBar Revision](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/config/sidebar?v=23086f2e-2b0a-11ec-b7bd-7ec702076c06&amp;v2=35539734-33c0-11ed-8e76-827c5c09f7c4), [Rule Wiki Revision](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules?v=8edc66a0-2fa1-11ed-8960-0e5bf4c500c8&amp;v2=bd2826e2-33c6-11ed-bfa7-fade6c9600c2) | We reordered the rules - Art Sources went from #2 to #3. The rules as listed on the /about/rules page had been reordered earlier on June 23rd.

In practice, this rule calls for moderator attention to every Fan Art post, as we manually verify every source link to ensure that the correct artist is identified, that the artwork is linked properly, and that the artist permits (or does not forbid) their work to be reposted/rehosted if done so. Automoderator does most of the heavy lifting by reminding users to provide the source as well as directing the source comments to the mod queue for review.

We tend to be lenient with users, but we will issue bans to users that repeatedly post unsourced art or that rehost art against artists' wishes. We will remove the posts and issue warnings via comments or modmail to the user, and after several warnings we move to escalating bans for each infraction.

I do want to note that users that repeatedly break the Reddit User Agreement (i.e., uploading content for which the user does not have the rights) are subject to action from the Admins. This is related to the DMCA process as well, whereby the original copyright holders (artists) can submit claims to have their content removed. DMCA claims are not sent to us moderators, but we will also remove any content if the original artist reaches out to us directly via modmail or in the post comments.

---

So with the detailing of the history and reasons behind the rule listed out above, now I would like to ask for your thoughts and feedback regarding the rule. I will add current full-text copies of the rule in the comments below as well.

* Do you think any parts of the rule should be rephrased or clarified? 

* Do you think any components of the rule should be added, changed, or removed?

* How do you feel about the current state of Fan Art Requirements on r/Zelda?

* One area of ambiguity is when art is rehosted here and the original artist does not list any message either permitting nor forbidding their work to be reposted. We know some artists will appreciate their work being shared here (i.e. ""Repost with Credit""), while others do not (i.e. ""Do Not Repost""). In the ambiguous case, we currently allow the rehosted artworks to stay up, but this can be difficult to sort out if the original artist does not have a reddit account or if a language barrier exists. What do you think?

* Another recent area of contention is the rise of AI-generated art. Currently we allow AI Art to be posted, but we require the program used to be cited in the post title. We also change the flair to ""AI Art"". Do you have thoughts on AI-generated art on r/Zelda?",,2,,6,rito,public

zelda,[LoZ] Tips for three heart run?,False,3,0,"My fiancé recently picked up the Zelda Game &amp; Watch, and I’ve been watching her play, sometimes guiding her through. She left it here for the weekend while she’s out of state visiting family, so I decided, hey, why not do a three heart run? I haven’t done one in this game since the GBA was new.

It’s kicking my butt pretty badly. I’m in dungeon six, and am struggling with the rooms that contain Wizzrobes, blue Wizzrobes, Like Likes, and Bubbles. I already got the magic rod, on the one attempt when I managed to get through, and after getting it I popped into dungeon eight for the magic book. I have the blue ring, magic shield, a red potion, and a good stockpile of bombs and rupees, so I think I’m about as prepared as I could hope to be… though I think the second bomb expansion is in dungeon seven, so I could also grab that I guess. I know there’s a red ring in Death Mountain, but you can’t get very far into it without the full Triforce, right?

Is there anything else I can do to get through more easily? I can’t really rely on bomb spam or chugging potion, because there’s one more room with the exact same grouping of enemies you have to go through before reaching the boss.",,0,,3,,public

zelda,[ALL] Is Ocarina of Time still the most accessible game in the series?,False,3,0,"Hey guys, wanted to get a quick discussion going since I've been thinking about this for a while.

Regarding every mainline game in the series from LoZ to BotW, is Ocarina of Time the one that we as fans could easily say is the best one to get people into the series with? Disregarding superfluous stuff like  ""le hecking 99 on metacritic best game of all time!!"" and all that. I was thinking of all the other 3D games in the series and LA/ALttP (imo LoZ and AoL just aren't worth it for newcomers) and OoT seems to be the one in my mind that makes the most sense to be someone's first.

* When I think of the other 3D Games, Majora's Mask is an instant no from me and not because of the quality (great game imo) but rather the sheer pressure the game puts you under to get stuff done.
* Wind Waker breaks from some traditions with the sailing and the endgame, particularly in the GC version, is never fun to go through again.
* Twlight Princess \[my personal fav Zelda\] is maybe a decent pick since it's ""Ocarina of Time...but bigger"" but its tone and mood are a heavy shift from most other games in the seires, plus there's that intro...
* Skyward Sword has the advantage of it being first game in the timeline but the controls could be a stickler for some. HD Version does improve this.
* BotW is another decent pick, but doesn't play like any other 3D Game in the series.

The above is just my opinion btw.

What are your guys' thoughts?",,12,,3,,public

zelda,[Other] What do you think of a Zelda game where Hyrule is portrayed as more inherently flawed and corrupt?,False,8,0,"Something that I've always thought would make a good Zelda game would be a game where Demise's hatred reincarnates not as a Gerudo, or demon... but as a member of the Hylian royal family, forcing the Link and Zelda of that game to work outside the system and not only save Hyrule... but fight against it to a degree. But something else has also come to mind. In a lot of modern media where heroes fight a villain who works in the system, they learn that the corruption in the system is a lot bigger then one person or a few greedy bigwigs. And we've seen so little of Hyrule's political machine in favor of monsters, dungeons, and adventure. But even those can thrive in the kinds of stories I'm talking about. 

So, what if there was a Zelda game, where we learn that Hyrule has a dark side to it? In the past, there has been the shadow temple, which was the royal family's torture chamber. And some not very good kings. But what if the next Zelda finds even more of that stuff? And while Link ans Zelda are on their adventure, they go through something similar to Ciri from *The Witcher*?

I haven't played a lot of games, but in the ones I did I noticed that the credits songs are usually incredibly well-made mashups of themes from the respective game and the Legend of Zelda common themes.

Heck, I get goosebumps just thinking about the horn solo playing the Legend of Zelda's main theme in the Skyward Sword staff roll song, and the whole arrangement's grandness really reflects -- and I kind of feel like it praises -- the adventure I finished.

But Breath of the Wild's credits, though... really disappointed me. There, the staff roll just plays the game's main theme and some of the game's town and character themes separately.. All the themes featured in the credit roll are very good (I'd say except for Urbosa's and Daruk's, which just feel like cutscene music), but there's no special effort put into it like I saw in Skyward Sword and Wind Waker, for example.",,5,,6,,public

Some argue the weapon durability is annoying, I never minded it. For most people who said botw is the best one, I asked them what ones they played and it's always just botw as the only one they played. It just isn't enough Zelda for my liking. I did really enjoy this one but it doesn't deserve this. There isn't the wonder of entering a dungeon and knowing your gonna get a whole new item to play with. Botw doesn't do that, there is no new item in every dungeon. Some people prefer this, me personally, I don't. The bosses are just uncreative and lazy. It's not like other bosses where they all are different creatures with specific weak points, attacks and background storeys. Like with volvagia being a dragon contained inside the volcano, phantom Ganon being a puppet created by ganondorf or the wild pig Ganon in twilight princess. The characters are just not as memorable as skull kid, saria, zant, the wind fish etc. This game is a great game, but doesn't feel like a Zelda game and I think it's very overated.",,641,,297,,public

zelda,[TOTK] Vaati is the mysterious figure in the new teaser?,False,4,0,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fccc4w6h8vr91.jpg?width=2600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce25185fc3fc0cf4ed8b4052711d5cb9275f8c63

Like most Zelda fans I have been wondering about the mystery figure shown in the newest teaser for Tears of the Kingdom. I at first assumed like many that it was the Goddess Hylia, but lately I think it may actually be the Wind Mage Vaati.

Some clues to it being Vaati are first and foremost the figure bares a strong resemblance to the first form of Vaati from the Minish Cap final battle.

Secondly we see an insignia on Links new sheild that is eerily close to the insignia carved on the wall at the sealing grounds that Vaati is usually imprisoned at.

Thirdly Vaati is a wind mage and he is basically always found and fought in the Palace of the Winds, a city that floats in the sky.

Fourthly the Minish Cap was a game directed by Fujibayashi and he is known to reuse characters and ideas from previous games of his.

Lastly it seems that Ganondorf is being resurrected in TOTK and Vaati has already done something very similar before in Four Swords Adventures.

Now, why Vaati is pairing up with Zelda in the artwork I have no idea, but I feel like there is a lot of compelling evidence that Vaati will appear in Tears of the Kingdom.",,8,,4,,public

The whole floating island thing of SS and the success of BOTW, it's just too easy to combine both and make a great game.

It also makes sense that there will be a combination of both games, given SS was first released on wii before it was released on the Switch. Nintendo wants players to familiarise themselves with sky island through SS.

zelda,[BotW] Regions of BOTW ranked,False,2,0,"Here is my ranking for the 15 regions in BOTW, let me know what you think of my list and what your list is in the comments!

1. Faron Region: Wow this region is awesome! Really picturesque and a great place to get a ton of food.
2. Hateno Region: It may look a little bland at first but it has everything I want in a region. A great Village. Some fun areas to traverse without being annoying and a Sheikah tower that isn't annoying to climb.
3.   Akkala Region: These next 3 could have been interchanged but I decided to give Akkala the bronze medal. Tarrey Town is definitely the highlight but aside from that it has a cool Autumnal aesthetic. 
4.  Hebra Region: I'm all for Snowy Regions and Hebra has a ton of it! It can be annoying to traverse the Mountains but it's still fun. Snowball Bowling also gets this region bonus points!
5. Wasteland Region: Gerudo Desert is extremely fun to run through with all the nooks and crannies. Gerudo Town is also one of my favourite settlements in the game. The Yiga Clan Hideout is also a nice feature.
6. Eldin Region: This region is pretty nice. Death Mountain is the main highlight here, but I also really like the Southern Mine. However, I find Goron City to not be that great in this game, imo it was done far better in OOT.
7. Lanayru Region: Contrasting Goron City, Zora's Domain is the bets it's ever been and looks beautiful. Getting there can be annoying but this is an overall good region. Just a shame there isn't much except Zora's Domain.
8. West Necluda: Kind of a meh region but hey it has Kakariko Village, my favourite village in the game. Duelling Peaks are also awesome! However, after starting the main quest I find there very little reason to revisit this region except to go to Kakariko.
9. Central Hyrule: This is decent. Hyrule Field can be both a blessing and a curse. One Half is tranquil and is no problem to get across, and the other half is swarming with guardians and other baddies. However, this can be a problem with travelling and I wish the enemies were more spread out.
10. Woodland Region: It's a bit of a mismatch but I kinda like it. Korok Forest is the highlight but apart from that I just find the whole thing to not really fit.
11. Tabantha Region: This region is very small compared to a lot of the others. Apart from Rito Village I find very little to do there.
12. Ridgeland Region: This one I just find to be a bit of a nothing region. Satori Mountain is the highlight but this region is just one that I run through and don't look back.
13. Lake Region: This region is quite boring but I do kinda like the North East of it which is filled with a dense Jungle, however, this is just the lead in to Faron and apart from that I find it to be really forgettable.
14. Great Plateau: It doesn't really do anything wrong, but I hate the tutorial of this game so that drags it down. 
15. Gerudo Region: Do I need to explain why this is last? Annoying to traverse, barely anything to do, and not that many shrines.

And then we have Zant, who's boss title is ""Usurper King Zant"". Not ""Twilit King Zant"". ""Usurper King Zant"". 

It's a pretty great break of convention, and it makes sense, because he'll never be ""Twilit King Zant"". Midna is the true leader of the Twili, Zant is just a pretender who used Ganondorf's power to usurp the throne and throw Midna out.

zelda,[ALL] Yet Another Zelda Timeline Concept,False,20,0,"Sorry if the image isn't pretty, I've reworked it a few times now.

Also, I hope I did the spoiler tagging and followed the rules correctly!

Some notes (spoilers ahead):
&gt;!-Technically, Triforce Heroes is officially placed after Link Between Worlds, and it can be there as well, but I just feel it works better after Spirit Tracks. Hytopia being a civilization near New Hyrule makes more sense to me.!&lt;
&gt;!-Majora's Mask, theoretically, would also have a split if we use my interpretation of bad endings being branches. I didn't include it because I couldn't fit it... even if I should have.!&lt;
&gt;!-Four Sword Adventures being a prequel to Link to the Past has a ton of evidence: it shows the origin of Ganondorf becoming ""Pig Wizard Ganon"" who steals a trident, introduces the concept of a Dark World, includes Maidens, and in the GBA Link to the Past, the Four Sword is present, broken into 4.!&lt;
&gt;!-The Broken Four Sword implies Ganon broke free of the seal and then sealed the Four Sword in the Dark World to avoid being sealed once more, unaware of the Master Sword.!&lt;
&gt;!-I made a note about this, but an argument CAN be made to move the ""Calamity Era"" events after Ganon is resurrected in Zelda 2's bad ending, but I personally prefer it to be where I have it.!&lt;
&gt;!-Final note... if you disagree, I would totally understand! The timeline doesn't really matter at the end of the day and is just fun to talk about.!&lt;

zelda,r/Zelda Meta Discussion - Rule 2: Mark Spoilers,False,3,0,"Hi r/Zelda,

To continue discussing the subreddit itself, with goals both to inform readers and to gather feedback, I intend to write up a series of weekly posts detailing each of the rules and their changes over the years. These will be added to the Meta Discussions collection, so you can opt-in to get notified for these posts if you ""follow"" the collection. With 13 rules, it should take a season to get through all of these.

---

**Rule 2 - Mark Spoilers** is our rule on spoilers. As listed in our [Short Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/about/rules/) and [Long Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules), this rules specifies that all Post Titles must be vague enough to not include spoilers, and specifies other details for how to handle marking spoilers in comments accordingly. This rule is also detailed further in a [dedicated wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/w/spoilerpolicy), which is updated around the release of new titles.

The core purpose of Marking Spoilers is to inform readers which posts contain them, so that we all can know whether a post will be relevant to our individual interests or contain possible spoilers before clicking or tapping into the post. In general, this usually is not too much of an issue, but there are heightened risks and concerns around the releases of new games, so we do tend to be stricter on this rule during those times.

Below is a timeline of when we updated our rule for Marking Spoilers. This rule dates back to the release of Skyward Sword for the Wii in 2011, but it has evolved with the releases of new games since then, especially Breath of the Wild in 2017. This rule is also generally intertwined with our rule on Title Tagging, so some of these posts were mentioned last week as well.

The rules as listed on the /about/rules page had been reordered earlier on June 23rd.

To note, we have never banned discussion of spoilers. We only remove posts that discuss spoilers if the post  is not properly marked for spoilers, or if the post title contains spoilers, or if the post breaks other rules.

On the other hand, we do issue bans for unmarked spoilers in two cases:

* For users that **intentionally** spoil any games for others, whether new or old - which falls under our rules on trolling. 

* During new releases, we make this stricter by issuing temporary bans to users that post unmarked spoilers, whether by accident or not. This is to prevent unmarked spoilers during the new release period.

---

So with the detailing of the history and reasons behind the rule listed out above, now I would like to ask for your thoughts and feedback regarding the rule. I will add current full-text copies of the rule in the comments below as well.

* Do you think any parts of the rule should be rephrased or clarified? 

* Do you think any components of the rule should be added, changed, or removed?

* How do you feel about spoilers for the upcoming *Tears of the Kingdom* release in May of next year?

* Generally, we consider details revealed in official trailers and officially released media from Nintendo to not be spoilers after a few days. This gives most users enough time to catch up on those trailers and media but does not place too much burden on those who wish to discuss it before release. This also gives us a good list of details that we can look to allow in titles once the game is out - i.e., anything not shown in trailers can be considered a starting point for spoilers during the first month or two of the game release.

* Leaks are a gray area, but will always be considered spoilers until after the game release period. We generally allow discussion of leaks, but we generally do not allow leaked materials to be hosted here as that can be a legal liability. For example, if a news blog publishes a leak or leaked details, then that can be linked and discussed here. But we do not allow users to publish leaks directly to r/Zelda, as that will usually run afoul our rules on piracy or trolling.",,4,,3,rito,public
zelda,[BotW] What’s inside Hebra north summit,False,3,0,"So I was snow shielding down the mountain and I ended up by some big stone door. I couldn’t open it, so I’m guessing it’s a mystery. Do we know what’s in there",,4,,3,,public

zelda,"[OoT] gets better the more that you play it, and especially when you replay it as an adult",False,84,0,"
I first played OoT when I was about 13 on the 3DS. I remember enjoying it a lot, appreciating it for what it laid out for the series, and being really impressed by how well it held up to this day, but I wasn’t like floored by it. There was no arguing the soundtrack, the characters, the settings, the dungeons were all iconic, but having played a lot of the later titles first it felt a bit barebones. I was also 13 and didn’t give enough attention to it as it probably deserved; I basically speed ran through the temples.

I’ve been replaying it on the Switch and the game has just absolutely floored me. I went in this time knowing the basics, how to progress roughly, where to go, etc., and so spent a lot of time just fucking around and exploring. The amount of side content in this game that I just missed first time round is staggering. There are secrets literally everywhere. The world feels alive in a way that’s simply unbelievable for a game made when it was. Every single inch of it is so charming, every gameplay loop and area has so much thought out into it, the sense of progression from helpless kid to hero of Hyrule is pitch perfect.

And speaking of the kid to hero arc, playing again as an adult is like seeing the game with a whole new set of eyes. Underneath the kind of basic story is something really deep and profound, and it’s told mostly through gameplay. Namely, the loss of innocence that comes with becoming an adult. Until you get the master sword, all of Links adventures are kind of fairy tale like; he faces an obstacle, overcomes it, and moves on in the way a child just goes day to day, not worrying at the larger issues at play and failing to grasp what problems are a running theme in their own lives. Link might get the Kokiri’s Emerald, but the Deku Tree is dead. Dodongo’s Cavern might be open for business again, but the Gorons are sitting on top of a threat lurking right inside their mountain waiting to burst out. Jabu-Jabu and Princess Ruto might be saved, but the Zora’s home is soon about to be frozen over and Jabu-Jabu will vanish anyway.

Link, in his childhood naïveté, thinks he’s ‘fixing’ problems, but he’s merely applying bandages to bleeding wounds, all while following the exact path that Ganondorf has laid out for him and Zelda. It’s not until he becomes an adult, and finds the world isn’t what it seemed to be, and sees first hand the consequences of the events of his childhood, that it all becomes clear that this problem is far bigger than a fairy boy and a girl princess could ever have solved.

Link saves Hyrule, but he has to give up his childhood and his innocence to do it. I think the moment where you first leave the Temple of Time as an adult is one of the most effective moments in gaming history. The cheer and the fun and frivolity is over. Happy, bustling Castle Town is a ruin populated by the dead. This isn’t a fun little childhood fairy tale where the boy from the forest and the little princess overcome the big mean bad guy; the boy becomes an adult haunted by the past, the princess has to become a warrior and hide as her kingdom falls to ruins, and Ganondorf gets to live in ultimate power for years unchallenged. 

And even though Link returns to his child’s body, he’s no longer a child. He’s back in this happier world, but he knows the darkness that’s lurking under the surface, just waiting for a chance to strike and ruin everything. He’s been under the well. He’s seen castle town in ruins. He’s been horrified by the shadow temple. He’s watched Zora’s Domain freeze over, seen Death Mountain live up to his name, and in the very end he’s abandoned by his best friend, Navi, the one solid link to his childhood. The Kokiri stay childlike forever and are never without their fairies; Link is not a Kokiri, he’s no longer a child, and so Navi leaves him. He’s left there, alone, a child old before his time, who’s seen and sacrificed too much for a world that will never even know the best of it only exists because one child was forced to endure the worst it had to offer way too soon.",,23,,84,,public

Maybe Phantom Ganon is the closest we're ever gonna get to seeing what's underneath? Since Phantom Ganon is of course created in the image of the real Ganondorf, he's still got short legs, but not as stubby as normal Ganondorf's legs seem to be.

While Zelda does the more standard well Zelda stuff.  have moments were they meet up at the edges of the twilight, most likely for the musical moments Zelda is known for. Possibly the new way to wake up the lake spirit's. And restore the section for Zelda to traverse fully, have Zelda be the one to learn from skele link. While Midna gains more powers link can use via the fused shadow.

When an area is cleared of twilight link will be transported back to Hyrule castle, where a new area of the castle would be explorable. While zelda finds new area's covered in twilight to open up warp points for link to explore outside of castle. Have an end engagement take place in the castle that requires both characters to perform puzzles in castle that link couldn't do himself.

And an end fight where Zelda is riding wolf link into the final boss, using skills of both. Zelda with horseback melee combat, wolf links speed and Midna abilities, possibly introduced as part of the previous section.

Have link return as human at the end, possibly as bit of a final surprise to the villain who otherwise pulled a last minute gatcha on the two. Letting Zelda get the final blow via light arrow.

PH it's so much fun and creative. Sure, it has its flaws, cof cof...Ocean King Temple.
But it got some of the best puzzles, treasure hunting, and bosses in the whole franchise. 

After doing the ""push the block on button"" thing in almost every Zelda, having to draw the map of a whale-island and look for its body parts for treasure was just so refreshing. For the first time in a while, i just didn't know what to expect when it comes to puzzle solving.
I mean, like you have to draw, scream on the mic, blow candles, even close the DS. I'd never thought i would see those logical Truth Tellers and Liars riddle again after high school. That was wild.

Also, Linebeck it's such a cool and underrated character. I know he is the greedy-guy-sacrifices-richness-over-his-friends cliché but i still wish we could've seem more from him. It broke my heart to see that he didn't even make a cameo appearence on the sequence.",,19,,42,,public

zelda,"[LoZ] finished the original The Legend of Zelda for the first time, WOW!",False,20,0,"An hour ago, I've finally beaten the first LoZ for the first time and I must say, I'm amazed!

 Little premise: I'm 21 years old, so I never had a NES. My first Zelda game was SS on the Wii and since then I started playing random Zelda games for the consoles I had (Wii and 3DS), but lately I decided to play all the ones I'm missing (almost 15). 

And where to start if not from the first one?

Since this is a NES game, I was expecting something bare bone, antiquate, cryptic and extremely difficult, but what I found is a fantastic game that gave me the same feelings as the new ones.

I knew nothing about this game before playing it (not even what the game looked like) except the fact that reading the instruction manual was extremely recommanded.

 I was a bit disappointed by the overworld at first but, thanks to the manual, I found soon the first “level”  and if the overworld was disappointing,  the first level was a really nice surprise. 

After clearing the dungeon, my idea was of exploring the overworld using the map in the manual, and thanks to this I easily found the blue ring. 

After this, clearing the other dungeons was pretty easy until a problem appeared: where are the other dungeons? The map doesn't show them, it only contains hints for dungeons 7,8 and 9 (pretty obvious ones), but where are dungeons 5 and 6? Fortunately, an old man gave me the hint about the waterfall and the woman in the waterfall sent me directly to level 5.

The only issue left was finding dungeon 6 and this is when I found the greatest merit of this game: it's not cryptic at all! Even if there are secrets with no hints pointing to them, they're easy to find thanks to the map. 

The map is made to help you the most by showing all areas you never explored, the locations of the dungeon, the heart containers (except for the one hidden in the bushes) and everything else is obvious.

I've said enough good things about the game, so let's jump to the bad ones: Ganon is horrible, some secrets are unfindable without a guide and finally: the lack of a sign for bombable walls. 

But except for this, I really liked this game and I can't wait to jump in Zelda II tomorrow (another Zelda I know nothing about, but I've big expectations).",,3,,20,,public

zelda,[BotW] How to get in to Breath of the Wild? I want to love it but I keep bouncing off,False,1,0,"I've pretty much bought a Switch just to play this game but I'm sad to say at the moment I'm feeling quite a lot of buyers remorse over it. I love the idea; I like open world games, I like the idea of the cooking and different systems and I like the IDEA of the choose your own adventure approach. However, when I do get the time to play I seem to wander aimlessly, only coming across little bobokin (or whatever you call them) camps that are fairly featureless with maybe just a single chest if you're lucky. 

I've been to two towns so far where the story sort of directed you but now I'm left looking for random locations of photographs it seems if I want to progress the story. I have stumbled across some cool little things but mostly the place seems almost a barren wasteland (albeit a pretty one). I've tried to go and unlock all the towers but other than the first couple you come to they all seem to have something that'll stop me, I'll get one shotted repeatedly then just end up either turning the game off or transporting back to somewhere I've already been. 

I'm not ready to give up yet because everything I've heard about the game is the sort of things I like but at the moment I'm just kind of stuck in a rut. Is there a town I should head to to get some more side quests going? Even where I've been so far it doesn't seem like there are many. Grinding out the shrines doesn't really appeal to me as I dont particularly enjoy them and having to do four just to get one more heart seems like a lot of effort. I thought I remembered something about a little house you got and could decorate yourself, how do I get involved in that? Basically any advice on a direction I should be going to get a bit more progress would be great.

I think the reason is because it basically works the same way an FPS works with ammo. Weak weapons are your generic pistol or rifle ammo, while more powerful weapons are your rocket launcher or BFG ammo. You use the weaker stuff for chaff and bust out the big guns for tough fights. 

When you think about it like this, it almost seems silly to get upset when weapons break. It's no different from running out of ammo for a certain gun and needing to switch to a different one.",,22,,29,,public

zelda,[SS] A theory on the time travel of Skyward Sword,False,6,0,"This is a theory that has been floating around in my head for a while now, so I thought that I would post it and get some feedback.

The time travel in Skyward Sword always bothered me. When analyzed using common time travel mechanics or the established conventions of the Zelda series, it just didn't add up, and created loads of continuity issues. Well, I believe that I have the answer to the question of 'how does time travel work in Skyward Sword?'. I have several pieces of evidence to prove this, and intend to justify my theory based on my knowledge of the game. If there are any flaws to my theory and logic, please feel free to point them out. Any alternative explanations to this issue are also welcome!

To understand the time mechanics of Skyward Sword we must understand how the gates of time function. From what we can observe, when activated, the gates join up two points in time that appear to move simultaneously, allowing for travel to and from the past. This is pretty obvious, as otherwise we would have multiple Links all popping in and out at the same time. It also goes in line with the plot, as during the time in which Link is powering up the master sword in the present, Zelda and Impa in the past are traveling from the temple of time to the sealed temple. It is also clear that changes in the past produce changes in the present, as evidenced through Link planting the life tree seedling in the past and it then having grown and matured in the present. This discounts the form of time travel in which all the actions taken by time travelers already happened, leading to no change in the future. (But more on that later).

The issues arise when we begin considering other forms of time travel known throughout the Zelda series and fiction. The most common form of time travel, in which changes in the past produce changes in the present, doesn't work as if it was the case, several continuity issues would arise. Near the end of the game, Demise is killed by Link wishing on the triforce, and Zelda awakens from her slumber. Girahim then kidnaps her, returns to the past, and uses her to resurrect Demise, or revitalize him, since he technically isn't dead at that time. He is subsequently defeated and sealed in the Master sword by Link. This would then mean that he would have been dead the whole time and that the events of the game would have been entirely unnecessary, as Demise would have been dead. It creates a grandfather paradox. Of course, this theoretical scenario contradicts what we see at the end of the game, as Link, Zelda and Groose return to a world in which the events of the game have still transpired, and Demise was killed by the triforce wish.

One might try to explain this with an alternate timeline theory, suggesting that when Link killed Demise in the past he created an alternate timeline in which he was defeated long before the game begins. But Link and Zelda still return to their own present, the one in which most of the game takes place, and there is nothing to suggest that the gates of time allow for travel between alternate timelines. So what's the deal then?

My theory is an altered version of the second form of time travel I mentioned, the one in which changes in the past produce changes in the present. I believe that this is still the case. However, the mechanics around it are different. This idea revolves around a known mechanic of the gates of time, the alignment of past and present to run simultaneously. When there is an active time in existence, the past and the present begin to run simultaneously. It is my belief that due to this, changes in the past affect the present, but without changing the time in between them. Allow me to explain.

Picture this:a rock sits on a blank surface. In the present it is in one position. In the past it was a few meters to the left, and during the time in between it moved a few meters to the right to end up where it is presently. How it moved is of no consequence. Then, a gate of time is opened. A person, we will call them P, goes back in time and moves the rock from its original position in the past even further to the left. In the present, this would of course cause the rock to be moved further left. Yet the time in between these two points remains unchanged, the rock still having moved from its original position in the past to its original position in the present. If P were to have watched the rock for a while in the present, then this would not change that fact, they still would have watched it move. When P moves it in the past reality in the present is rewritten to account for the rock's movement, but the time in between doesn't change. Yet the past and the present remain changed. I hope that makes sense.

So how does this apply to Skyward Sword, and does it account for the time travel? To answer this question, we must look at all the main instances of time travel within the game. There are four of these instances in the main story of the game, so there isn't too much to work with.

1)Impa and Zelda to the past, using the gate at the temple of time. (Gate one)

2)Link to the past, after having activated gate two with the Master sword.

3)Link to the past with the fruit of life, in order to grow the tree of life and heal the Thunder Dragon. Using gate two of course.

4)Girahim, Zelda, Link and Groose to the past using gate two, in which the game's final battle takes place.

It is important to note that I have discounted any instances of traveling to the present from the past, as this has no consequence on the continuity of Skyward Sword, which is what is being discussed here.

**Instance one**

Early on in the game, Zelda and Impa travel through gate one and into the past. I won't explain the details of this event, since it is unnecessary. Go and watch a video on the story of Skyward Sword if you must. But it is the consequences of this event that are of concern. Zelda and Impa end up in the past, and gate one is destroyed by whatever Sheikah bomb Impa used. This is interesting, because it means that there are no active gates of time in the world, with gate two still being deactivated until Link remedies that. I believe that this causes the effects of the time travel to work differently, as the past and present are no longer aligned. The first form of time travel that I mentioned earlier (remember that I said it would later be relevant) is what I believe then occurs. This is supported by the fact that Zelda can be seen in her sealed crystal at the very beginning of the game, when you first descend to the surface, if you look through a crack in the back doors of the sealed temple. This obviously tells as that Zelda is therefore destined to go and seal herself in the crystal, and that doing this in the past does not change the present as it had already happened in the timeline nonetheless. I think that this is what happens when there are no active gates of time in existence, that the actions taken in the past become part of the timeline that the present results from.

**Instance two**

Later on, after having tempered the Master sword in the three sacred flames, Link uses it to activate gate two in the sealed temple. This then means that there is an active gate of time in existence, and that the previous form of time travel that I have established, the one in which actions in the past affect the present without changing the time in between, is reinstated. I won't explain the full detail of events, but Zelda ends up sealing herself in the crystal to maintain Demise's seal nonetheless. Considering the way in which the gates of time operate, aligning the past and present, this would be ineffective as Zelda would only appear in the crystal in the present, and the time in between would not have changed. This of course does not add up with what we literally see. However, it is most likely that in the original version of events that took place before Link activated gate two and returned to the past, that Zelda sealed herself in the crystal without their encounter taking place, and began her long slumber. As the time in between the past and the present does not change in my proposed form of time travel (which I will refer to as mechanic one, with the other that takes effect when no gates of time are active being mechanic two), the aforementioned problem created by mechanic one is nullified, as Zelda is maintaining the seal anyway.

**Instance three**

In instance three, Link returns to the past, having gathered the life tree seedling, in order to plant it in the past, grow a life tree, and harvest the life tree fruit in order to heal the Thunder Dragon. Mechanic one is in line with this, as planting the life tree seedling in the past would cause there to be a fully grown life tree in the present. Now, if changes to the past altered the entire timeline, then the tree would have always been there, which it is not. Groose also reacts to the tree's sudden appearance, suggesting that it appeared in the present when Link planted it in the past. This further supports my theory.

**Instance four**

Now here is where things start to get interesting. After having destroyed Demise in the present, Zelda is freed from her slumber but before they can all celebrate, Girahim kidnaps her and returns to the past in order to revitalize Demise whilst he is still alive. This of course eventually results in Demise's defeat. With mechanic one in play, we can conclude that there is no consequence to this, as Demise was already dead in the present, meaning that his death in the past does not produce any result. However, there are more important things to mention. Before returning to the present, Link plants the Master sword in the pedestal, putting it and Fi to rest. This of course would cause it to appear in the present, without any changes being made to the rest of the timeline in between, which does not mess with the game's established continuity. Now, there is the matter of Impa's, or should I say, Zelda's bracelet. Before returning to the present, Zelda gives Impa the bracelet. According to mechanic one, this would cause Impa to have it in the present, but before that we saw her with the bracelet when we first encountered her in the sealed temple after having first descended from Skyloft. So, what gives? Well, remember mechanic two, and how it came into effect after gate one was destroyed? I think that before sealing herself in the original timeline, before Link went to the past and changed it, that Zelda gave Impa the bracelet, same as we see in the cutscene before they return to the future in our version of events. So, like with Zelda's sealing of herself after the opening of gate two, this does not change anything. I admit, this is not guaranteed to have happened, but I realized this as a potential flaw whilst writing, and this is the only way that I can explain it. But there is not evidence against it happening either. With this explanation, my theory still works.

Once Zelda, Link and Groose return to the present, Impa in the past destroys gate two, eliminating the last gate of time from existence. I think that the effects of mechanic one's existence are not erased because of this, as they still happened whilst the gate was still active. But now that both gates are destroyed, time travel is no longer possible, meaning that no further explanations of continuity issues are required. Yay for me!

I have now provided all the evidence for my theory and why I believe that it explains the convoluted time travel in Skyward Sword. If you made it to the end of this post, then I congratulate you. It is very long, and I understand that it is quite a lot to explain time travel in one of the Zelda games, and that some might not be concerned with that. But I wanted to post it, to get it out of my system, and to potentially give any others an interesting read and an explanation for something that might have bugged them after having played Skyward Sword.

Thank you for reading, if you did. I hope my words make sense. feel free to comment for clarification, or to challenge my theory and maybe provide alternative arguments. As I said at the start, all are welcome!",,15,,6,,public

1 year ago, I gave myself the challenge to 100% any of the mainline Zelda games and document it on reddit. Having beaten the first 4 games one year ago, after some time I decided to pick up the challenge again and start playing OoT and Majoras Mask.

I will jump straight to the rating and my own opinion :)

# The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

This game is really a masterpiece. It all started here, in my opinion. I would suggest every zelda interested person to 100% this game. The sound design really was the cherry on top. I really love playing games and just getting lost in the tunes. One of my favourites beeing the spirit temple and market music. It just slaps.

The game breaking the 2D barrier and dipping into the world of 3D is really unparalleled in my opinion.

The deeply involving storyline paired with the intuitive controls and an overall great experience makes this game one of the best if not the best game ever developed.

Rating: 100/100 a literal masterpiece

The game has probably one of the hardest tasks ever given to a videogame: beeing the sucessor of OoT. The game still manages to be a great game. In my opinion, it is not equal to OoT. The game lacks ""pace"" at the start of the game. It starts off really slow. The 3-day schedule really inspired my creativity. Boundaries are set at the start of the game, and you have the rest of the game to get comfortable with it. I really loved exploring every nook and cranny to get information on new missions. Without the bombers notebook this game would be a nightmare.

The music is really well made. One of the best tracks is the astral observatory.

The game was hard at some places. I needed to google some clues in order to get the game at 100%.

Rating: 95/100 (-5 points for the lack of pace at the start of the game)

zelda,[ALL] Updating a chart for Getting into The Legend of Zelda - Which order do you suggest for the games?,False,26,0,"Check this out!: https://imgur.com/a/aqzTapx

Two of the [most frequent questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/faq) we get posted here to r/Zelda are:

* *Which game should I start with?*, and  
* *Which game should I play next?*

Generally speaking, the typical answers to this are to start with whichever game, and play whichever game you can get next, as most games can be played in any order. 

That said, there are some games that are more popular than others, and some games that do have spoilers for others, and some games that are more similar to each other. So for someone looking for a little more context in making their decisions, it is nice to have that information organized.

About five years ago, /u/Vernalddpdwie made a helpful chart to guide players on choosing which game to play and [posted that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/73rrzg/i_made_this_flowchart_on_getting_into_the/).

This weekend, I have taken a shot at updating that chart, including showing for which platforms each game has released.

Overall, I recommend starting with ALttP, OoT, LA, or BotW - all available on Switch! Then based on what you like or dislike about those, you can branch out to other games. 

What do you think? Do you have comments on the updated chart? I am still looking to add a few more lines of text to it, so I am open to suggestions on additions or edits.",,11,,26,rito,public
zelda,"[ALL] Zelda, Link, Ganondorf: Best design discussion",False,4,0,"So I figured I'd bring up this wonderful age old question. But I was wondering which games had the best designs for the main trio of Triforce owners. Purely from a visual standpoint this time instead of personality wise at least for the sake of this discussion.

- For Link my personal favorite is his Hyrule Warriors design. The shoulder guard, chain mail, and blue scarf are really fantastic additions to his usual attire and gives a good showcase of how this iteration of Link was already a career soldier before taking up the mantle of hero.
- For Zelda I actually have the hardest time choosing since she has a lot of interesting variations. In the end though I go for her Twilight Princess design. It's one of the forms that gives her that very commanding ruler presence about her for a mature yet regal presence you simply can't help but bend over in reverence.
- For Ganondorf once more I settle for his Hyrule Warriors design. Dude's huge, imposing, and has amazing hair to fit the ""desert warrior"" asthetic. His Dark Beast form was also pretty quality as well to help clinch it, though it wasn't the best of them.
- Finally as a bonus for Ganon I'd say OoT was probably his best incarnation. The combination of his huge form plus the lighting on the battlefield made him a truly terrifying sight to behold for a climactic final battle.
- (bonus) Hyrule Warriors also has my favorite version of Impa as well, just pure badass she was.

zelda,r/Zelda Meta Discussion - Rule 1: Title Tags and Post Flair,False,4,0,"Hi r/Zelda,

To continue discussing the subreddit itself, with goals both to inform readers and to gather feedback, I intend to write up a series of weekly posts detailing each of the rules and their changes over the years. These will be added to the Meta Discussions collection, so you can opt-in to get notified for these posts if you ""follow"" the collection. With 13 rules, it should take a season to get through all of these.

**Rule 1 - Title Tags and Post Flairs** is our rule on post topics and relevance. As listed in our [Short Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/about/rules/) and [Long Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules), this rules specifies that all Post Titles must begin with a Title Tag, and that Post Flair is required.

*Edit: I forgot to mention that this rule used to be listed as Rule 13 until the past couple months, when we re-ordered our rules. All other rules were moved one spot down on the list.*

# Title Tags

Most of our Title Tags come from the [commonly used abbreviations](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_Abbreviations) for the various entries in the Zelda Franchise, but we do have a few additional tags too. Sometimes, we allow specific temporary title tags for special events, [like [Place]](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/twet0x/place_for_a_moment_there_was_perfection_and_peace/).

The core purpose of Title Tagging is to inform readers which games the post is about, so that we all can know whether a post will be relevant to our individual interests or contain possible spoilers before clicking or tapping into the post. Some other features that Title Tagging provides us are:  

* Blocking an overwhelming majority of spammers,
* Allowing better searching and filtering of posts, especially with 3rd party tools,
* Encouraging users to read the rest of our rules before posting.

Below is a timeline of when we updated our rules for Title Tags over the years. More of the history on our Spoiler Policies and Fan Art rules will be the topic of later posts.

2019.03.28 | [Test Post - See Automod Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/b6mspm/test/) | We start using Automoderator to enforce Title Tags, shortly after the [Cadence of Hyrule announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/b3e351/cadence_of_hyrule_trailer/).

To summarize, we first began enforcing Title Tags on all post titles around March 28th, 2019 using Automoderator, though we had used similar required title tagging to help us enforce spoilers around the release of Breath of the Wild in March 2017 and around the release of Skyward Sword in November 2011.

Currently, Title Tags are enforced by Mod Tools Post Requirements. The main difference between Automod enforcement and Mod Tools enforcement is that Automod would tell you in detail only after you submit your post, and Mod Tools tells you without detail before you submit your post.

# Post Flair

We use post flair to categorize content types. We started out with just a few flairs and have added more over time. These flairs allow users to browse or search for specific types of content they are interested in, and they also work with old reddit search filters to allow users to block content they were uninterested in. 

Post Flairs also allow us moderators to set specific reminders for corresponding content types - art sources for fan art, text bodies for discussions, Merchandise on Mondays only, and more. Consistent post flair also helps both mods and users find previous posts to check for and reduce reposts.

Below is another timeline of updates to Post Flair:

2021.05.18 | [Mod Post - Rule Changes and Survey Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/nfa3tw/rule_changes_and_survey_results/) | Music flair added.

Because it is not possible to change post titles after submission, sometimes we adjust post flairs to add critical information without removing a post - for example, to compensate for a misleading or inaccurate title, or to update on the status of something. This was more common in the earlier days of reddit than it is now though.

zelda,[TotK] [SS] The Forgotten Temple is the Isle of Song (the Thunderhead is back!),False,21,0,"This theory is not new; however, I believe it has been heavily overshadowed by the theory that the Forgotten Temple is the Temple of Hylia (from Skyward Sword). I can understand why this theory has become the universally accepted one, after all it's the most intuitive. The Forgotten Temple obviously dates back to the Era of the Sky, and the most important temple in SS is the Temple of Hylia.

The “biggest proof’ is the fact that both the Temple of Hylia and the Forgotten Temple possess the largest Goddess Statue we can find in Hyrule. The BotW statue is much smaller, though. Many argue that the reason why the size has changed so much is the different art style of the game. An absolutely valid reason. However, it loses a bit of value the moment you realize that in SS there is ANOTHER big Goddess Statue, and that is of the exact same size as the one in the Forgotten Temple. I'm talking about the statue on the Isle of Songs (located inside the Tower built on it). The statue in the Temple of Hylia is MASSIVE compared to the one in the Forgotten Temple, while the one on the Isle of Songs matches perfectly! Moreover, the statue of the Temple of Hylia is exposed outside the building (and it’s also taller than the temple itself), while the statue on the Isle of Songs is hidden inside the building (like the one in the Forgotten Temple). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Link's size compared to the Statues](https://preview.redd.it/gp2tmxrystp91.jpg?width=350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844d12feedf5093948f958c447d1e8a39dcbc371)

Finally, let's talk about its position. After the end of Skyward Sword, the Goddess Statues descended to Earth, returning to their positions in their original temples. So, looking at the BotW map we can see that if the Isle of Songs returned to Earth, it would land in the region of the Forgotten Temple. Considering that in SS we never explored that region of the Surface, there is no way to disprove that there was a temple underneath the Thunderhead. Most importantly, the Temple of Hylia should be located in the Great Plateau, since the Temple of Time IS the Temple of Hylia rebuilt from its ruins, so… again, it's obvious that the Forgotten Temple is something else entirely (a temple that was truly ""forgotten""...)

&amp;#x200B;

[Comparison of the maps](https://preview.redd.it/8u4qyxzyutp91.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0940622b6314e36009a38286627aa85a2226979f)

Now, let's talk about Tears of the Kingdom. We didn't get too much information about the map, however the official artwork revealed the appearance (or return) of a very interesting place. I'm talking about the Thunderhead! See how that cloud formation aligns perfectly with the castle and volcano, compared to the Skyward Sword map.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Thunderhead is back?](https://preview.redd.it/us9v9gduvtp91.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c97e7fbd267db0d686253176fd3e32b8b1db0469)

The Thunderhead seen in the TotK's artwork is located exactly above the Forgotten Temple!!! It's totally possible that the Goddess Statue is going back to the Sky, resulting in the formation of the legendary Thunderhead with its original purpose of protecting it.

If I HAD to say this new being was related to any other being from the Zelda universe, my first guess was the Keaton race. They were present during The Minish Cap, and many theories surrounding the new game (and cut BotW content) relates to TMC, the Wind Tribe, the Minish, etc. So... *maybe*?

But I remembered that BotW was supposed to lean heavily on the very first game, so I checked out those enemies and remembered the bizarre unsolved mystery that is ""Pols Voice.""

zelda,[TotK] I hope there's a Post Game mode instead of NG+,False,8,0,"
Does anyone else wish that you could enjoy the world in a post ending peace instead of a hard restart/load previous save ending? I can see why they couldn't do that with BotW so easily but I really hope we can continue exploring and do fetch quests after the final event of the game with maybe some bonus quests and such. It would obviously have to not conflict with any DLC if they plan on doing any DLC. A Master Mode is also still welcomed.

Some post game ideas I had:

-Help rebuild towns/supply, material, fetch quest

-Companion quests ie. help npc's or even dogs traverse trails or gather ingredients, etc.

-Add post game rare materials to add unique properties to equipment/weapons

-Zelda follower.. she just follows you around with funny and informative commentary (like if you walk by some ruins, she gives a brief history of the place) and helps fight baddies (assuming the story allows this &gt;.&gt;)

-And maybe post DLC/Last DLC.. FIERCE DEITY MODE. Basically God mode with crazy skill sets and modifiers ie, smack bokoblins into the horizon, sunder enemies with bolts of lightning, levitation, etc. Just post game party mode basically.",,5,,8,,public

You can get off Great Plateau and head to Hyrule Castle. It is possible. So what about the other quests we have done? I mean, im on my Korok Hunt, Compendium Hunt and my Miniboss Hunt right now. Already got all towers, all shrines, all side quests. Will they be canonical? I still want to see Tarrey Town, getting big and with a lot of people. Also, how are we going to see the map?

Of course I could be totally wrong and this thing might be a flying magic rock for all we know but I think it might make sense.

zelda,[BOTW] I finally found what I wanted BOTW to be!,False,0,0,"So I’ve often gotten into arguments here and across other forums about why the complete openness of BOTW just didn’t work for me. Mostly it’s related to the complete removal of the dungeons, and the feeling of more wandering than exploring. 

I picked up this random indie game the other day and it’s exactly what I wanted. It’s more Souls inspired but the map and exploration is the main focus of this post. There’s an absolutely massive open world at the center. It’s probably 90% the size of the BOTW map. It’s got puzzles, “shrines” with puzzles to reach the loot at the top, mini bosses akin to the Hynox fights, a giant castle in the distance, etc. Here’s the kicker…

It’s all gated! The central open world is surrounded by “closed” worlds you visit for story progression. They’re dungeons, but much larger. Each one takes about 2-3 hours to full explore and beat. You can initially explore only 25% of the open world until you complete the first closed world (it’s the only closed world available). This full exploration took about 10 hours. Once you get the sword and key you open another 25% of the open world and two new closed worlds. 

It’s also worth pointing out that these closed worlds are difficult. Your exploration of the open world prior to tackling them is incentivized because that’s where most of your character/weapon upgrades items are found. That’s exploration with a purpose, not just wandering. 

The game is Shattered: Tale of the Forgotten King if anyone wants to check it out. Do NOT pay $30 for it. It’s a $10-15 game for sure.",,11,,0,,public

zelda,[All] Topic of Discussion :),False,1,0,"Hello! I’ve struggled to make this post or to get this thought out to others because I don’t want to seem “woke,” hateful, or pretentious. I understand written words don’t always carry the same context spoken words may, but I promise I say all of this in the best way possible: I’ve loved The Legend of Zelda as long as I can remember, and I will always love the series, but as I’ve grown older I’ve realized something that keeps sticking out to me and that confuses me, and that’s how Tetra’s design is treated in Wind Waker in regards to the color of her skin. When Tetra receives her role as Zelda, her skin color changes into a lighter tone, and I’ve read of people online talking about this and considering it racism from the developers, but I don’t want to immediately assume that’s the case because I don’t have enough information to create an educated thought. I am not light-skinned, but just because I love The Legend of Zelda does that mean Link, Zelda, or anyone else in the games has to have my color of skin as well or I’ll dismiss it as racism. I simply find Tetra’s case odd, but I’d like to read what you all have to say. If anyone read this, thank you so much.

[Edit] Okay so a lot of comments seem to mention canon and warriors not being part of Zelda so it doesn't count. Why is either of those things important here? Im merely talking about the almost near identical map APPEARING in 3 games (which it defenately does unless people have a really bad eye sight). Im sorry but why bring canon into this? And yes, I said ""...in Zelda..."" but that beggs the question why AoC isn't Zelda. Just because its officially a Warriors title and not A Zelda title doesn't change the fact that its all about BotW and its characters (unless, again, people have really bad eyesight). And yes I mentioned that I think it isn't important but some people like to zoom on evey single detail so I might as well point it out.

I indeed forgot about AlttP and AlbW with the ancient stone tablets which did feature the same map so I was simply wrong about it. Thats why I asked if it happened before in the first place.

zelda,[TP] I Restarted Twilight Princess After 10+ Years...,False,20,0,"...And I love it. It's really, really cool. I'm barely an hour in but I feel immersed into the story, characters and setting. Ordon Village is a gorgeous jewel and feels intimate being surrounded by the trees and mountains on all sides. The game's artstyle is pretty to look at: Link's home is incredibly cozy with all the light rays piercing through the ceiling and windows. There are many books and pens as well meaning that Link likes to read and write. Perhaps Link wrote some of the books here, making stories for the children habiting the village. I loved hearing the sounds of the forest when you first go search for Epona, it feels peaceful and meditative.

I found a precious puppy in one of the villager's home who was very very happy to see me. The tail was wagging and it wanted to lick my face. Good god this is the best game ever, you can actually CARRY the puppy ! I put the dog on the table and looked in first person making its big snout fill up my screen. I pretended to kiss it on the snout then went away after struggling to step out the door. It was just so happy to see me.

I enjoyed exploring the village in search of rupees to buy the Slingshot. And what a powerful tool it is ! It just exploded a scarecrow's pumpkin head just as if I shot at it with a cannonball !

The combat seems a lot more focused on Swordplay than Breath of the Wild. I appreciate you can swing your sword in different directions in a smooth and epic way. The hits also feel powerful.

And god did they make Link handsome in this game. No wonder they keep him away from the big town, dude would be a superstar of handsomeness there and his ego would go through the roof.

If anything goes wrong, perhaps it's because the villain is jealous that Link is so pretty.

I am feeling just so hyped to go to Hyrule: the game does a great job hyping you up for the trip and that's where I will go soon. But I have the feeling it's not going to go so well...

So yeah, I really, really enjoy the beginning of Twilight Princess. Some people think it's too slow, but I feel like it's setting the story really well and I'm actually sad it may not go like this for longer...

zelda,[TotK] [BotW] Theory: Could the Leviathans within BotW hold larger significance in TotK?,False,61,0,"In BOTW, there exists gigantic skeletons of creatures referred to as ""Leviathans"". There are three leviathan skeletons in total, found at completely different areas in hyrule. There is one in Hebra, one in the Gerudo Desert, and one behind Death Mountain. So far, the only creatures who match their size are the three dragons. These dragons are able to be observed flying high above the clouds, and if you shoot any of them with arrows, they will make their way to a sort of portal high in the sky, after which they completely disappear.
Could this portal be one to the sky kingdom? Now, from the anatomy of the leviathans, we can assume that they were also capable of flight. This is a very important feature of the leviathans' anatomy that ties into this theory.

Why are these leviathans here? Where did they come from? And why are they so blatantly riddled across the map? (With the exception of the Hebra leviathan) And just how old are they exactly? This question has been raised many times throughout the lifespan of botw's theory community. From what we know, they were considered ancient well before the calamity.

After the new trailer we recently received during the nintendo direct, some have pointed out that there seems to be a sort of dragon-like creature hidden behind one of the sky islands, as we can see what appears to be a tail of sorts. Some have also pointed out that it doesn't seem to belong to any of the known dragons of hyrule. See where I'm going with this?

Some have theorized that we will be traveling back in time during the main story of TotK, to the great war thousands of years in the past. I am unsure if this is the case, but for the sake of this theory, I will consider this a possibility. If the sky Islands were a thing of the past, as many speculate, than could this dragon-esque creature be one of the leviathans? Could the leviathans have existed during this long-forgotten time? And if so, could the leviathans play a bigger role in the larger narrative? Perhaps they could play a similar role to the dragons in botw. But why, then, are they dead? Are they just normal creatures that existed alongside the ancient civilizations, unlike the dragons who represent the goddeses?",,10,,61,,public

God damn, something about this game's presentation just strike me some type of way. This game literally just feels like the happiest part of my childhood. It gives me the feeling of when I used to explore the massive woods that surrounded my small Pennsylvanian childhood home. The green leaves from the vegetation, the blue sky above dotted with clouds, and the somber pleasant breeze. Wind Waker just brings back all of those pure feelings that I had when I was a kid who'd go on imaginary adventures in the woods, swinging a big stick around like a sword.

Again, I never played this game when I was a kid, so these feelings don't come from association. The only other game I've ever vibed with on this level is Little Nightmares 2. Funnily enough, it's because that game made me feel things from my childhood too. I didn't have many friends when I was a little kid, so I did feel lonely and isolated a lot, and where I lived it stormed and rained constantly. Many days were overcast and dark. So whenever I play LN2 I get the feelings of calmness and somberness from my youth, and when I play the WW I feel my former upbeat happiness and sense of adventure.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way about Wind Waker, I know a lot of people still don't even like it's art style. But I just can't stop having these pure feelings of bliss whenever I play it.",,111,,1266,,public
zelda,[OoT] theory on the fallen timeline,False,7,0,"so i was watching a theory video by BanditGames on the abandoned timeline and i was thinking of how it could work and  
what if link only uses the master sword to go back in time once? when link first uses the master sword to go back in time he alters the past and that changes the future by normal time travel logic he has created a new timeline where the adult timeline happens, now what about the original timeline where he had first used the master sword to go back to his past and change the future? i believe this is the fallen timeline with link not being there anymore no one is left to stop ganon and he wins, but for this to happen it would mean that link only goes back in time once so that only 1 fallen timeline is created unless there are multiple fallen timelines and we only see 1 because they are all identical or well thats just a theory

Majoras Mask 3D seems to improve on some of the more tedious, obnoxious parts of the original (ie, just waiting around for things to happen).

I haven’t played SSHD but if it improves the motion controls and cuts down on Fi’s unnecessary interruptions, it could really jump the game up considerably.

zelda,[all] (spoilers) ranking all the games i've played based on how dark they are.,False,3,0,"Games i've played but havent finished:

Wind waker


Games i have played and also finished:

Zelda 1

A link to the past

Link's awakening 2019

Ocarina of time

Breath of the wild


I also heard a few things about majora's so im gonna rank it too


7. Zelda 1.

 I chose this one because it has a a really shallow and cliché story. You could argue that only a few people existing living in caves and no towns are dark but its probably just limitations.


6. Wind waker.

 I've only just started the forest dungeon and its a bit dark with hyrule being flooded and aryll or whatever her name is being kidnapped but its nothing too extreme yet.  


5. Link's awakening.

 Its a hard decision between this and alttp but i went with this thanks all the wacky characters and enemies like tarin or that band of frogs.

Still, its quite a sad game if you think about marin and the others being just a dream. Its also relatable since everyone has had a dream where something amazing happened but they woke up and felt sad after.


4. Breath of the wild

The game is all about a silent apocalypse.

Humanity almost goes extinct during the calamity, and after 100 years, still just barely holding on. Small civilizations are few and far between. And nobody has hope for a bright future other than link and his allies. 

there are huge roboric spiders crawling around hyrule which have unmatched power and speed explained by npc's who somehow got away from one.

The memories show zelda's struggle with unlocking her power with no time to spare while she's getting progressively more frustrated as the calamity comes closer every day.

The champion descendants being the exact opposite of their ancestors shows how hopeless they are.

Zelda waiting for link for 100 years holding on with the last of her strength shows that the world is indeed on the edge of the cliff really close to ending.

But all this is HEAVILY balanced out by everithing else which places it only at 3th place






3. Ocarina of time

I think this game has either super dark or super light hearted aspects so its a bit more balanced out than number 3.

For the dark aspects:

Deku tree dies right at the the beginning and sends link, a young kid yet to see the world on a quest to save hyrule.

Uh.. i cant think of anything dark before adult link so ima just skip there.

First thing you see is castle town in ruins, with its only inhabitants being redeads: horrible looking zombies which have such a terrifying scream, that stops you from moving so they can get close and cling onto you doing go knows what.

Then you see lon lon ranch taken over by ingo who isnt a good guy i dont remember why exactly.

Fast forward to bottom of the well and shadow temple and you realize how fucked up the game is, when you encounter dead hand, who is a terrifying zombie like creature who grabs you with its hand to eat you.


I also wanna mention the dying soldier, the gorons in the fire temple held there to be eaten, and the fact that kokiri dies when leaving the forest.



2. A link to the past.

Many people overlook the game's atmosphere thanks to the cute pixelated graphics, but if you look past that its super dark. 

Right at the prologue the game shows you the SKELETON of the dead king sitting in his throne,

Your uncle dies in front of you after probably being stabbed

You meet a soldier who knows he is going to get mind controlled like the others and just waits peacefully

You are seen as a criminal in kakariko village and some people snitch on you when seeing you

Right after you finally get the master sword, ready to fight aghanihm, you go to the sanctuary after being told about shit going down you see the sage fucking dying right in front of you and zelda nowhere to be seen, kidnapped, and its all because you were so focused on getting the master sword that you failed to protect zelda.

After fighting aghanihm, you get your first taste of what the dark world really looks like, and its a bitter world where nobody is on your side, and people care about nothing else other than taking your money or killing you.

Oh, i havent even mentioned about flute kid and his father yet, Or the bully next to spectacle rock dark world

Another thing is the lack of the modern zelda atmosphere. The one where everyone is cheerful and help you as much as possible with the friebdly gorons and zoras and funny characters like the zora king or beedle, which means jts constant dark atmosphere.

The one thing that makes it significantly less dark is the ending where all the bad ganon has done is just deleted.


1. Majora's mask.

You saw this one coming and im not gonna get too deep in it, cuz you all know why its number one

THE FUCKING MOON IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE WORLD IN 3 DAYS!

yeah.. not only that but the characters..

On day one no one really cares about the moon.

On day two they start to notice it inching closer every second and get a bit concernded

In day 3 they panic. Knowing well that they will die that day

In the final hours they accept it. 
The people eho marry each other shows this really well.

There is also the deku butler's son, a happy kid turned into a mask by skull kid only leaving a lifeless shell of his former body.


Im way too fucking tired to make any more points.

Please share your tougths with me because im really curious about your rankings

zelda,"[ToTK] What if the Figure in the mural is one of, if not the 3 Golden Goddesses that predate Hylia?",False,4,0,"From the newest trailer, we see that the mysterious Dragon looking figure whose holding onto the 7 teardrop looking symbols seem to have enough power to be the main deciding factor that stopped a previous Calamity ages past, despite the fact that the power of Goddess Hylia, through Princess Zelda by proxy, would've been present to ideally combat the encroaching malice. Furthermore, additional scenes from the mural further depict how this mysterious figure is also capable of either sealing Ganondorf/lifting Zelda out of Malice, (and how princess Zelda of ages past seemed to have some sort of relationship with this figure) 

While previous incarnations of Zelda and Link were definitely able to fight off Ganon and his forces, the longstanding assumption was that just the powers of those two was enough to truly fight off Ganon and his forces. This is especially since Zelda is blessed with the powers of Goddess Hylia, and each Link is the reincarnation of the titular Hero who slew Demise, the root of Ganon's origins. However, there has never been a single Antagonist in the entire Zelda franchise of which Link and Zelda's combined capabilities, alongside the help of supporting characters, isn't enough to end any of Hyrule's threats. The fact that this strange figure not only seems to be the key to ending a calamity of ages past DESPITE the presence of Link, Zelda, and the unified military might of Hyrule at least seem to suggest that this individual's capabilities are more along the lines of an ancient being like the dragons. 

However, its unlikely that this muraled figure is one of the ancient dragons is unlikely for   
2 reasons. First, even the original dragons from Skyward Sword likely wouldn't have the power necessary to be as game-changing as the mysterious figure in the mural was during one of the ancient calamities. As seen in Skyward Sword, even though Lanayru, Faron and Eldin all had the agency to stop Ganon and to safeguard the lands of Hyrule, when push came to shove it ultimately still fell to either Link or Zelda to salvage the situation. And while we haven't seen these ancient dragons in action, its unlikely that they have the ability to deal Demise a serious blow anyways simply because they didn't do anything to stop Ganon even though they had access to an entire mining apparatus for timeshift stones within the Lanayru province. 

Lastly, the current iterations of dragons introduced in BOTW, Dinraal, Farosh, and Naydra, don't have the abilities to stop ganon either as they're implied to each be roughly equal in power and influence, but yet Ganon was able to fully corrupt Naydra with just his malice form. 

Thus, if even the oldest and arguably most powerful iteration of ancient beings across the Zelda timeline are unlikely to be able to deal a serious blow to Ganon, then I find it unlikely that this unknown figure in the murals can be anyone that was previously seen in the timeline. Instead, the only other contenders could be the golden goddesses who birthed the world. Not only would they be the only ones who could rather easly clap either Hylia or Demise, but they've also been the last resort for when the world goes to shit. For instance, prior to the events of windwaker, the goddesses directly intervened by flooding the world before Ganon could kill off Hyrule. Even though Hylia could've intervened directly, the fact that those 3 still did means that they are not beyond directy salvaging Hyrule's impending doom.",,0,,4,,public

Now for ganondorf to be the ancient hero he would need the master sword and as we see only the one who posses the spirit of the hero can wield the master swor meanwhile the incarnation of demise would get obliterated by the blade

So after this info there are 2 solutions and bith of them require a 4th timeline before oot, eithe A) in this world instead of the hero incarnating as a young hylian boy he for some reason chose the gerudo king meanwhile demise staying for thousands of years without a body becomes so angry he manifests malice and the calamity with his original body being sealed in the master sword but that doesnt explain the corpse we see in the first trailer unless its somehow twilight princess ganon, i believe eijy aunuma(i butchered his name ik) said that botw its way later in the timeline after it fused and now we have 2 ganondorfs, 1 is the twilight princess ganon since he is the only one of the 3 timelines who still had his body intact, and the ganondorf that is an incarnation of the hero 10k years ago",,7,,3,,public

I thought the Zora's were handled really well and this was the first game to portray them in a way that does them justice. I wasn't a Zora person before but now I have played BoTW they have found themselves a new fan.  


My best time however was that spent with the Gerudo. They were really fleshed out this time. Much more than we have ever seen. They are the most intriguing race to me, even more than the Sheikah and I had fun learning about their culture. I also very much enjoyed the introduction of greetings and other words in their own language.  


I found Gorons were given a rough deal this time and their portrayal in TP was much better, this seemed like a total downgrade for them and I was not sad to leave them behind when it was time to go.

zelda,"[TotK] [MC] Theory: The Zonai ""mysteriously disappeared"" by raising their tribe, and palace to the sky. They are serving their ""greater purpose"" by lowering back down and will be key in saving Hyrule. The Zonai are the Wind Tribe from MC",False,56,0,"Doing some digging for clues about the Zonai, I came across [this image](https://i.imgur.com/sWhVBPX.jpg) from 'The Minish Cap' which shows not only a Darknut clad in armour with the serpents/dragons that are associated with the Zonai, but a huge building in the background which is a dungeon called 'The Palace of Winds'. In digging around a little more, I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/o4kb8p/botw2_speculation_are_the_zonai_based_on_the_wind/) from a year ago which goes much more in depth about the [Wind Tribe](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Tribe) whom the palace belongs to. If you don't want to check it out, the Wind Tribe are people who once lived on the surface, but using magic they have ascended with their palace into the skies in order to protect it.

To strengthen the relationship between the Zonai and the Wind Tribe, the [Wind Tribe](https://i.imgur.com/KW5G3cE.png) uses the a [swirl](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/e/eb/TMC_Home_of_the_Wind_Tribe.png/revision/latest?cb=20200905200837&amp;format=original) and keeps the [Wind Element](https://i.imgur.com/R9ZFAYI.png) in their palace which is the same shape, much like the Zonai have on [their ruins](https://i.imgur.com/3Mxpouj.jpg). They also left [ruins](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Ruins#The_Minish_Cap) which are in the jungle area of the [Castor Wilds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/3/3b/TMC_Castor_Wilds.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20091204161738&amp;format=original). Possibly the most significant is the symbol on the center of [this platform](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/494636104612315146/1020323304243998740/TMC_Fortress_of_Winds_5.png.jpg) made by the Wind Tribe bears a tremendous resemblance to [the final shot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/494636104612315146/1019265881156636712/unknown.png) in the last trailer where two ""tears"" are in the same circle.

Some quotes from the Wind Tribe to further convince you:

&gt;"" *The people who built the Wind Ruins (Zonai ruins?). They now live above the clouds, suspended by their own magic ability to control the wind.* ""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*Although we are of the Wind Tribe, we, too, once lived on the surface. Once, the place you call the Wind Ruins was, to us, a home.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*Our tribe abandoned the place you call the* *Wind Ruins... With our magic, we moved our palace up into the skies. We are the* *Wind Tribe.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*In this tower dwell the people of the Wind Tribe. We left your surface world long ago to serve a greater duty. We now protect the gate to the Palace of Winds, where the Wind Element lies.*""

[This massive structure](https://i.imgur.com/uRDyYVE.png) that keeps appearing in the trailers I believe might have something to do with the Wind Tribe/Zonai. When the Zonai are said to have ""myseriously disappeared"" they might be referring to when the Wind Tribe took their palace and Tribe to the sky. So this structure might actually be the palace lower down closer to the ground so that they can *serve their greater duty*.

Their greater duty I believe might be watching over Hyrule and only intervening when they know that the world will end as we know it. We know they are able to know what is going on, on the surface since:

&gt;*""The leader of the Wind Tribe knows everything happening on the surface by listening to rumors carried by the wind.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;and ""*We have been watching, and we know all that happens on your surface world. We know a small boy collects* *elements* *to lift the curse from a princess. We know of* *Vaati* *and his evil acts... The winds tell us these things.*""

I also believe the islands that we see in the trailers aren't risen from the ground, but they actually are being lowered with the structure as well. It wouldn't make much sense to me if they were raised up, since the ruins on them aren't visible to us in BotW.

Oh, and all of them have red hair and are definitely all Groose's descendants.

Another theory that is definitely a stretch, but a fun one:

Artifacts of the Wind Tribe might be present in Skyward Sword as well. A robot called [Mazaal](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/a/af/TMC_Mazaal_Sprite.png/revision/latest?cb=20180927225542&amp;format=original) was created to defend the Fortress of Winds in 'The Minish Cap' so they were not only skilled with magic, but with technology as well. Mazaal look very much like [Gohdan](https://i.imgur.com/GD10jXn.jpg) as well, and has a design much more similar to the Zonai that we know from BotW. Keeping in mind the [colour of their clothing](https://i.imgur.com/KW5G3cE.png) and the colour of Mazaal, the Wind Tribe seems to like the colours red and blue. The ancient robots in Lanayru, for example the [Scrapper](https://i.imgur.com/rVSHisU.jpg), [Armos](https://i.imgur.com/tns3jN7.jpg) and [Beamos](https://i.imgur.com/hDzRCjv.jpg) have a similar colour scheme to them, so they might have been made by the Wind Tribe while they were living on the surface. The Beamos, though having many different iterations over all the games, looks quite similar to this concept art of a [Guardian Turret](https://i.imgur.com/WgWKM88.jpg) and [this Beamos](https://i.imgur.com/BpM1YBb.png) from TP might even have the Zonai swirl on around its head.

The Mining Facility in Lanayru is very different from what the Zonai design is in BotW, but since it's in the desert it's not unreasonable to think that it is just very deep underground due to the thousands of years being in a desert. Maybe due to more caves opening up in TotK this area might reveal itself again. As well, due to the facility mining [Timeshift Stones](https://i.imgur.com/1MKyu0e.png) which look extremely similar to these [Giant Columns](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/0/08/BotW_Giant_Column_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20210621071522) that the Guardians were said to have come out of, they might just be from extremely ancient Sheikah tech. Or what I would prefer: the Zonai, Wind Tribe and Sheikah are related.

zelda,[TotK] My Theory: The God of Darkness,False,3,0,"So, to start I'm calling this The God of Darkness theory, one because it matches, and because i needed a title for this post that wouldn't get flagged as repetitive.

First and foremost, if you haven't watched the trailer yet, here it is:  [(2) The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Coming May 12th, 2023 – Nintendo Switch - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SNF4M_v7wc&amp;ab_channel=Nintendo)   


The first thing to mention about this is lots of people have analyzed this trailer and many people have come up with all kinds of different theories. while lots of them feel like good explanations, they don't quite match up with the whole picture and they just don't feel right to me. two very good theories that I have seen are these two videos I'll link below, however they both end at the same point, and again I feel this is wrong. keep in mind this is nintendo and Zelda. there's usually a lot of unknowns surrounding these games, and despite all theories and the way something might look, the end result usually throws us all for a loop, and I don't expect this to be any different.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KD8d7YI4NE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KD8d7YI4NE)  
 [(2) The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Trailer Complete Analysis - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9SYtmE9UBU&amp;ab_channel=BanditGames)   


Now both these are really well put together theories and analysis videos, and I watch both of their content pretty regularly so I do like these people, but I can't help but feel they are going in the wrong direction with this. Now with the introduction out of the way, let's get into my theory.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The first thing of importance is the imagery of the Ouroboros. For those that don't know the Ouroboros is a symbolic meaning of Destruction and Re-creation, not rebirth, and not life and death, these are just different ways of interpreting that meaning, but for the sake of this theory, we're going to look at it in its flattest meaning and form: Destruction and Re-creation. There are a few key points in Nintendo's trailer (the first video I linked) and these are their timeframes numbered for ease of reference:

1 - 0:16 (The War)

2 - 0:30 (The Figure)

3 - 0:34 (The Sacrifice)

4 - 0:47 (BotW Link)

5 - 0:55 (Time Travel)

6 - 0:59 (TotK Link)

7 - 1:13 (The Ouroboros and the Main Image)

(lol i somehow came up with 7 key points, like the 7 sages lmao)

Okay so each of these key points show an important piece to this theory, the other stuff in the trailer is cool and important too, but these are the parts that are the most important. First let's talk about a few notable things about Zelda. We all know that since Skyward Swords retconning of the three goddesses and Hylia, we know that every Zelda is the reincarnation of Hylia. This means that Zelda in botw herself is Hylia (i know a lot of theories say otherwise but I'll address that later on), which means the figure at timeframe 2 isn't Hylia, because Hylia is already there in the form of Zelda. now that that's out of the way, let's get into the theory...

\- Starting with Timeframe 1, the big things of note are that Ganons forces are enshrouded in malice and are winning a battle against an unknown race of people. The second thing to note is that their design is that of the one in TotK, not BotW. This is important because this means a distinct change happens at one point or another, and it's happening again. We also know that creatures like Bokoblins and Moblins in Zelda exist without Ganon, but that these ones in BotW are made from or powered by Ganon's Malice, so it's possible that Ganon's presence and malice changes them somehow.

\- The Next thing to talk about is Timeframe 2: The Figure. This is an interesting image, as there are lots of different interpretations on the figure itself, and the depiction of this particular image of it. The first things to note is that it's holding these 7 orbs and is using them somehow. Now it's a popular theory that these are the 7 sages and I totally agree with that. We'll get back to this. The other thing is that there are clouds and streaks of some kind. There is a lot to unpack here, and I will, just got to unpack the rest so I can explain my theory.

\- Timeframe 3: The Sacrifice. We can see the figure of Zelda floating above a pool of malice that is rising towards her. There's a part here that no one else seemed to notice though, that someone has their arm outstretched towards her off to the very right, almost like they are the ones doing this, like a sacrifice.

\- In timeframe 4 we can see Link running to jump off a cliff (BotW Link), and in timeframe 6 we can see link climbing a tree root on one of the floating islands (TotK Link). we can also see BotW Link reverting time to reach one of the floating islands in timeframe 5. These are the most important information pieces in this video, as it means time travel is a for sure thing, and its affecting Link in odd ways as is evident by his hand and the state he's in.

\- The last piece of information is in Timeframe 7, where we see the logo for the game, the Ouroboros symbol, and The Figure and Zelda holding hands under an orb, almost like a ritual.

Okay, so now that we've established all the important information, let's get down to the theory. There is obviously a very heavy theme of Cycles what with the Ouroboros imagery all over the place, and Zelda and the strange figure, seeming to be two side of the same coin. Now A lot of people theorized that the strange figure is Goddess Hylia coming to help Zelda, or that Zelda is becoming Hylia, because that's been her journey, but the thing is, she already IS Hylia, and when she's reincarnated, she has to relearn how to use her powers just like a newborn baby learning to walk. It's safe to say that the rituals of Zelda going to each place and pleading with the goddess for wisdom, is just that, a ritual and it holds no other meaning, its simply how the people of this world have come to interpret it over the ages, and as stories passed down overtime often do, the story gets muddled and altered. Yes, there is in-fact the thing of praying to the goddess statue as a game mechanic and her speaking back as Goddess Hylia, but this could just be a remanence of Hylia's being leftover. Afterall it's very common in Japanese culture (folklore? sorry I don't know the right way to say it) that deity's have shrines and if one prays at a deity's shrine, it gives them life more or less, and the more that people pray to them, the more ""real"" they essentially become. it could be that this is what's happening, so it's not really Hylia herself, but the worlds interpretation of her given life. this also would explain the dark statue in Hatano, the one that people hadn't prayed to in a long time before you come around. The reason this statue is the way it is, is likely due to how the people of Hatano see it, this ominous devilish misinterpretation of their beloved Goddess Hylia, hence why its malevolent and corrupt. nobody prays to it, and those that do, pray bad things. So, this means that Zelda is in fact Hylia, which means this other figure in the trailer is NOT Hylia.

The Ouroboros is a prominent Symbol in this game and its meaning is, in most direct terms, Destruction and Re-creation. This means that this game is heavily themed around the idea of a never-ending cycle of destruction and re-creation. It's fair to say that in Timeframe 7 when we see the figure and Zelda holding hands, that this is not only what the Ouroboros is referring to, but it's also a Ying and Yang, life and death, light and darkness. If we know that Zelda in this depiction is actually Goddess Hylia, then we know that Hylia is the light, and that means this other figure, is the dark.

I think at this point it's quite clear where I'm heading with this. The Figure seen in timeframe 2 isn't Hylia, it's a new deity that we haven't ever seen, or rather it's a deity that's been there the whole time, one that is a bringer of darkness. before you shout at me in the comments, I can in fact back this theory up.

If you look at timeframe 2, it's clear that The Figure is doing something magical and is using the seven orbs to do it. I was vague on my wording of this image before because there are two ways of interpreting this image. The first way you can interpret it is that this creature is using the 7 sages to part the dark clouds and shine light down onto Hyrule, or you can interpret it as this evil entity has captured the seven sage, and is bringing dark clouds, rain, and storms onto Hyrule. To further support this idea, when is the last time you saw the 7 sages? I can't remember them being present in BotW at all, nor any mention at all of them, which is quite odd considering there's always at least SOME mention of them in every main entry 3D Zelda game, hell even Windwaker  and twilight princess speak of them, but here, they've been absent. the Triforce itself has as well, but we know that Zelda uses the Triforce's power so maybe that's okay, but we know the sages are for sure absent and this dark entity having them isn't good.

Another thing to back this up is in timeframe 3. This is obviously the scene in the first trailer where Ganondorf is sacrificed, however in this picture we see that its Zelda instead. The thing is, the one whose sacrificing her is The Figure from timeframe 2, this dark entity sacrificed, not Ganondorf, but goddess Hylia herself to the malice of Ganon, plunging this world into darkness for all of eternity.

Now I know that sounds weird but hear me out. After the events of Ocarina of time, link returned to the past to go find Navi, and because of this he was missing in the adult timeline, so when Ganon attacked again in the Windwaker, there was no one to stop him and Hyrule was flooded. in this game a young boy had to rise to the occasion to become the new hero because no other hero existed in that timeline anymore. This is very similar to that, the goddess Hylia is being kept in a state of undead, so she's both dead, and alive, meaning she'd be able to reincarnate, but a lifeless vessel still remains. This is why it's so hard for this version of Hylia to reobtain her powers, she essentially is calling upon something that doesn't exist, similar to what Windwaker link had to do. but if that's the case then why does she look like Ganondorf and not Zelda?

I have a theory about this as well, and I feel like it fits it all perfectly. We know that because of timeframes 4, 5, and 6, that link does some time traveling, and it begins to affect him in strange ways. there's one piece of the 10,000-year-old legend in BotW that no one was ever able to make sense of, and its who this man is in place of link?  


[guy on the right](https://preview.redd.it/aoa64bbpbao91.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08235864dde435ce7422988074e2e26ae493628c)

He wields the master sword and wears the champions clothing, yet his hair isn't golden, its red, and he has a boar like face and teeth... So, it can't be link right?? I think it's possible that whatever the time manipulation does, these 'Tears"" of the kingdom, affect him, transform him into a grotesque monster akin to those born from the malice, and it's entirely possible that this sacrificial ritual has been doing the exact same thing to goddess Hylia for all these years, turning her into a grotesque monster (sorry gdorf). 

If you all remember in the original TotK trailer, reversing the audio gave a message. It's still not entirely clear, but lots of people think it sounds like ""please help"" and ""please find my body"" etc.. this fits so well with Hylia being imprisoned in a timeless death by this dark deity, that its disturbing.

TLDR: in short, this figure is the God of Darkness, and the person being held in a state of undead is the Goddess Hylia herself, a previous version of Zelda from 10,000 years ago. This is a game about a never-ending cycle of the destruction and recreation of both Hyrule, link, and the goddess Hylia. If I'm right, this is gonna be one dark game.",,4,,3,,public

• Landing on some form of bird (the robot/drone in the TOTK teaser looks like a replacement/call back for Loftwings)

• Upgrading the Master Sword (tbf, I can't remember if we've ever had to repair it, but that can just be TOTK's way/version of upgrading it)

###The possible unique elements:


• An underground area

• Some of the abilities (runes) are obviously unique

• Link's Arm and outfit (aesthetically unique)

• Finally learning more about the Zonai

• Some new enemy designs

• Other small/specific aesthetic changes

I'm sure the game will be great and there's obviously a lot they haven't shown us, but I'm scratching my head at what seems truly unique from what we know thus far. So far it seems like a mixed bag of previously used ideas which could still lead to a great game.",,7,,0,,public

I think that's what the subtitle means. And you use these ""tears"" to transport yourself to that kindgom like we saw in the trailer.

See how Link uses his power to ride the rock upwards? I think he's using a time reversal power on that rock to transport himself to the area in the sky. That rock is probably a chunk of land that fell off and landed on Hyrule. Link's power is merely retracing its steps, so to speak.

Maybe the game is also about turning back time since we see some time inversion in the trailers. The title has the word ""tears,"" which might refer to the kingdom being physically torn apart and tears from people crying. It might be a spoiler since there has to be something that might cause a whole kingdom to cry. Something so bad and irreversible, like death, that turning back time is the only way to fix this event.

zelda,[LA] New Glitch / Memory Exploit get photos early Link's Awakening DX,False,37,0,"I've accidentally discovered a way to unlock photos early in Link's Awakening, and, if researched more, it may be possible to unlock the ""Steal from Shop"" photo without causing your name to be changed to THIEF.

It started as I was farming enemies for a piece of power and I unexpectedly suddenly had the Red Tunic from the color dungeon. This is an already-known memory overflow glitch which I executed by accident, if you don't know about it, it's detailed here: [https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches\_in\_Link%27s\_Awakening#Obtaining\_Colored\_Tunics\_Without\_Visiting\_the\_Color\_Dungeon\_(Including\_Extra\_%22Damage\_Sprite\_Tunic%22)](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches_in_Link%27s_Awakening#Obtaining_Colored_Tunics_Without_Visiting_the_Color_Dungeon_(Including_Extra_%22Damage_Sprite_Tunic%22))

However, as I paused the game to see yep, I have the red tunic, I also saw my photo count - it said I had 1 out of 12 photos. I hadn't been to the camera guy yet. So curious, I went to the camera guy, got my photo taken... and now it says have 2 out of 12 photos. I inspected the album, and found that in addition to the starting photo, I also had the Zora-At-the-Pond photo, which is impossible, since I only finished the first dungeon.

I've tried to reproduce this and I'm not sure how. Somehow the enemy count memory exploit can do more than just change your tunic - it can unlock photos too! So I'm wondering - the most annoying photo in LA is one that forces you to choose between keeping your name or having full photo completion. With this exploit, if exact details get figured out, you might be able finish the album and keep your name.

I've tried to search online and can't find any other detail of unlocking photos using this memory glitch. Does anyone have any detailed knowledge of this? Or know where I could go to find people who do?

The only thing I was doing differently from the tunic glitch is I had Bow Wow with me so he was eating enemies at the same time which made it hard to farm the exact number of baddies.",,2,,37,,public

She left it here for the weekend while she’s out of state visiting family, so I decided, hey, why not do a three heart run? I haven’t done one in this game since the GBA was new.

It’s kicking my butt pretty badly. I’m in dungeon six, and am struggling with the rooms that contain Wizzrobes, blue Wizzrobes, Like Likes, and Bubbles. I already got the magic rod, on the one attempt when I managed to get through, and after getting it I popped into dungeon eight for the magic book. I have the blue ring, magic shield, a red potion, and a good stockpile of bombs and rupees, so I think I’m about as prepared as I could hope to be… though I think the second bomb expansion is in dungeon seven, so I could also grab that I guess. I know there’s a red ring in Death Mountain, but you can’t get very far into it without the full Triforce, right?

zelda,[Other] What do you think of a Zelda game where Hyrule is portrayed as more inherently flawed and corrupt?,False,7,0,"Something that I've always thought would make a good Zelda game would be a game where Demise's hatred reincarnates not as a Gerudo, or demon... but as a member of the Hylian royal family, forcing the Link and Zelda of that game to work outside the system and not only save Hyrule... but fight against it to a degree. But something else has also come to mind. In a lot of modern media where heroes fight a villain who works in the system, they learn that the corruption in the system is a lot bigger then one person or a few greedy bigwigs. And we've seen so little of Hyrule's political machine in favor of monsters, dungeons, and adventure. But even those can thrive in the kinds of stories I'm talking about. 

So, what if there was a Zelda game, where we learn that Hyrule has a dark side to it? In the past, there has been the shadow temple, which was the royal family's torture chamber. And some not very good kings. But what if the next Zelda finds even more of that stuff? And while Link ans Zelda are on their adventure, they go through something similar to Ciri from *The Witcher*?

I did really enjoy this one but it doesn't deserve this. There isn't the wonder of entering a dungeon and knowing your gonna get a whole new item to play with. Botw doesn't do that, there is no new item in every dungeon. Some people prefer this, me personally, I don't. The bosses are just uncreative and lazy. It's not like other bosses where they all are different creatures with specific weak points, attacks and background storeys. Like with volvagia being a dragon contained inside the volcano, phantom Ganon being a puppet created by ganondorf or the wild pig Ganon in twilight princess. The characters are just not as memorable as skull kid, saria, zant, the wind fish etc. This game is a great game, but doesn't feel like a Zelda game and I think it's very overated.",,641,,303,,public

After doing some quick Google searches, I found out this was the most beginner friendly LoZ, so I chose this one  to play. I got the game on my GameCube because I don’t own a WiiU. And I have to say, I love it.
The story and art design are very fun and I’m fond of the battling system. It’s just so cozy to play and I had an amazing time. But I will say the game became a lot more tedious in the second half. The constant back and forth and side quests were incredibly annoying and sort of ruined it for me. Outside of that though, this is an amazing game and it’s up there as one of my favorite games. I just wish the game stayed consistent in quality.

zelda,r/Zelda Meta Discussion - Rule 2: Mark Spoilers,False,5,0,"Hi r/Zelda,

To continue discussing the subreddit itself, with goals both to inform readers and to gather feedback, I intend to write up a series of weekly posts detailing each of the rules and their changes over the years. These will be added to the Meta Discussions collection, so you can opt-in to get notified for these posts if you ""follow"" the collection. With 13 rules, it should take a season to get through all of these.

---

**Rule 2 - Mark Spoilers** is our rule on spoilers. As listed in our [Short Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/about/rules/) and [Long Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/rules), this rules specifies that all Post Titles must be vague enough to not include spoilers, and specifies other details for how to handle marking spoilers in comments accordingly. This rule is also detailed further in a [dedicated wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/w/spoilerpolicy), which is updated around the release of new titles.

The core purpose of Marking Spoilers is to inform readers which posts contain them, so that we all can know whether a post will be relevant to our individual interests or contain possible spoilers before clicking or tapping into the post. In general, this usually is not too much of an issue, but there are heightened risks and concerns around the releases of new games, so we do tend to be stricter on this rule during those times.

Below is a timeline of when we updated our rule for Marking Spoilers. This rule dates back to the release of Skyward Sword for the Wii in 2011, but it has evolved with the releases of new games since then, especially Breath of the Wild in 2017. This rule is also generally intertwined with our rule on Title Tagging, so some of these posts were mentioned last week as well.

The rules as listed on the /about/rules page had been reordered earlier on June 23rd.

To note, we have never banned discussion of spoilers. We only remove posts that discuss spoilers if the post  is not properly marked for spoilers, or if the post title contains spoilers, or if the post breaks other rules.

On the other hand, we do issue bans for unmarked spoilers in two cases:

* For users that **intentionally** spoil any games for others, whether new or old - which falls under our rules on trolling. 

* During new releases, we make this stricter by issuing temporary bans to users that post unmarked spoilers, whether by accident or not. This is to prevent unmarked spoilers during the new release period.

---

So with the detailing of the history and reasons behind the rule listed out above, now I would like to ask for your thoughts and feedback regarding the rule. I will add current full-text copies of the rule in the comments below as well.

* Do you think any parts of the rule should be rephrased or clarified? 

* Do you think any components of the rule should be added, changed, or removed?

* How do you feel about spoilers for the upcoming *Tears of the Kingdom* release in May of next year?

* Generally, we consider details revealed in official trailers and officially released media from Nintendo to not be spoilers after a few days. This gives most users enough time to catch up on those trailers and media but does not place too much burden on those who wish to discuss it before release. This also gives us a good list of details that we can look to allow in titles once the game is out - i.e., anything not shown in trailers can be considered a starting point for spoilers during the first month or two of the game release.

* Leaks are a gray area, but will always be considered spoilers until after the game release period. We generally allow discussion of leaks, but we generally do not allow leaked materials to be hosted here as that can be a legal liability. For example, if a news blog publishes a leak or leaked details, then that can be linked and discussed here. But we do not allow users to publish leaks directly to r/Zelda, as that will usually run afoul our rules on piracy or trolling.",,4,,5,rito,public

zelda,"[OoT] gets better the more that you play it, and especially when you replay it as an adult",False,86,0,"
I first played OoT when I was about 13 on the 3DS. I remember enjoying it a lot, appreciating it for what it laid out for the series, and being really impressed by how well it held up to this day, but I wasn’t like floored by it. There was no arguing the soundtrack, the characters, the settings, the dungeons were all iconic, but having played a lot of the later titles first it felt a bit barebones. I was also 13 and didn’t give enough attention to it as it probably deserved; I basically speed ran through the temples.

I’ve been replaying it on the Switch and the game has just absolutely floored me. I went in this time knowing the basics, how to progress roughly, where to go, etc., and so spent a lot of time just fucking around and exploring. The amount of side content in this game that I just missed first time round is staggering. There are secrets literally everywhere. The world feels alive in a way that’s simply unbelievable for a game made when it was. Every single inch of it is so charming, every gameplay loop and area has so much thought out into it, the sense of progression from helpless kid to hero of Hyrule is pitch perfect.

And speaking of the kid to hero arc, playing again as an adult is like seeing the game with a whole new set of eyes. Underneath the kind of basic story is something really deep and profound, and it’s told mostly through gameplay. Namely, the loss of innocence that comes with becoming an adult. Until you get the master sword, all of Links adventures are kind of fairy tale like; he faces an obstacle, overcomes it, and moves on in the way a child just goes day to day, not worrying at the larger issues at play and failing to grasp what problems are a running theme in their own lives. Link might get the Kokiri’s Emerald, but the Deku Tree is dead. Dodongo’s Cavern might be open for business again, but the Gorons are sitting on top of a threat lurking right inside their mountain waiting to burst out. Jabu-Jabu and Princess Ruto might be saved, but the Zora’s home is soon about to be frozen over and Jabu-Jabu will vanish anyway.

Link, in his childhood naïveté, thinks he’s ‘fixing’ problems, but he’s merely applying bandages to bleeding wounds, all while following the exact path that Ganondorf has laid out for him and Zelda. It’s not until he becomes an adult, and finds the world isn’t what it seemed to be, and sees first hand the consequences of the events of his childhood, that it all becomes clear that this problem is far bigger than a fairy boy and a girl princess could ever have solved.

Link saves Hyrule, but he has to give up his childhood and his innocence to do it. I think the moment where you first leave the Temple of Time as an adult is one of the most effective moments in gaming history. The cheer and the fun and frivolity is over. Happy, bustling Castle Town is a ruin populated by the dead. This isn’t a fun little childhood fairy tale where the boy from the forest and the little princess overcome the big mean bad guy; the boy becomes an adult haunted by the past, the princess has to become a warrior and hide as her kingdom falls to ruins, and Ganondorf gets to live in ultimate power for years unchallenged. 

And even though Link returns to his child’s body, he’s no longer a child. He’s back in this happier world, but he knows the darkness that’s lurking under the surface, just waiting for a chance to strike and ruin everything. He’s been under the well. He’s seen castle town in ruins. He’s been horrified by the shadow temple. He’s watched Zora’s Domain freeze over, seen Death Mountain live up to his name, and in the very end he’s abandoned by his best friend, Navi, the one solid link to his childhood. The Kokiri stay childlike forever and are never without their fairies; Link is not a Kokiri, he’s no longer a child, and so Navi leaves him. He’s left there, alone, a child old before his time, who’s seen and sacrificed too much for a world that will never even know the best of it only exists because one child was forced to endure the worst it had to offer way too soon.",,23,,86,,public

zelda,[BotW][TotK][AoC] I really hope we get these two types of weapons from Age of Calamity in the Tears of the Kingdom,False,5,0,"When playing Botw and getting the Sheikah set, one thing that really dissapointed me was that there were no swords in the game that were short and could be held in reverse grip to complete the ninja look/theme.

However, in Age of Calamity, Impa's weapon seems to be a new type of weapon based on the icon right next to it's name. ([Kakariko Kodachi](https://imgur.com/a/C4PZEEN))

There's no weapon in botw of this type. And Impa [holds her kodachi in reverse grip](https://imgur.com/a/BXJEXIu) just like I was hoping Link could hold a short sword in Botw. So I hope that the Zelda team will add this type of short blade in Tears of the Kingdom.

Also, I think it would be cool too if they add the two blades types of weapons just like Sooga's [Swords of Ferocity](https://imgur.com/a/v51ZbtT) in Age of Calamity. Once again the icon next to it's name shows two swords and theirs no such weapons in Botw.",,1,,5,,public

By that I mean when Link fails in other games, evil has won definitely so time still goes on,  but you can't make games about it.

I never played too much of Skyward Sword (which is where I think the answer to my question might be so I feel a little silly for asking), but is there a reason as to why Zelda is called well, Zelda, in terms of the story rather than why the creators of the series called her that?

Don't know why i decided to replay one if my least favorite Zelda games, but i'm glad I did. I had such a cool experience this time, completely changed how I see this game and how It scores amongs the others.

PH it's so much fun and creative. Sure, it has its flaws, cof cof...Ocean King Temple.
But it got some of the best puzzles, treasure hunting, and bosses in the whole franchise. 

After doing the ""push the block on button"" thing in almost every Zelda, having to draw the map of a whale-island and look for its body parts for treasure was just so refreshing. For the first time in a while, i just didn't know what to expect when it comes to puzzle solving.
I mean, like you have to draw, scream on the mic, blow candles, even close the DS. I'd never thought i would see those logical Truth Tellers and Liars riddle again after high school. That was wild.

Also, Linebeck it's such a cool and underrated character. I know he is the greedy-guy-sacrifices-richness-over-his-friends cliché but i still wish we could've seem more from him. It broke my heart to see that he didn't even make a cameo appearence on the sequence.",,19,,39,,public

About how it could look: in my opinion is hard to imagine how would look like, but something sure is: the story would be totaly different, maybe they live in a society where things like deitys magic and monsters are just tales, but discovering that those stories were real.

And what i think the community will think: i dont know for sure, but i know that there will be 3 groups at least: the fans that liked the game, the ones that didnt like that Nintendo changed the style, and the ones that are really deep in the lore trying to fix the timeline (again).",,13,,6,hylian,public

I want to love it but I keep bouncing off,False,3,0,"I've pretty much bought a Switch just to play this game but I'm sad to say at the moment I'm feeling quite a lot of buyers remorse over it. I love the idea; I like open world games, I like the idea of the cooking and different systems and I like the IDEA of the choose your own adventure approach. However, when I do get the time to play I seem to wander aimlessly, only coming across little bobokin (or whatever you call them) camps that are fairly featureless with maybe just a single chest if you're lucky. 

I've been to two towns so far where the story sort of directed you but now I'm left looking for random locations of photographs it seems if I want to progress the story. I have stumbled across some cool little things but mostly the place seems almost a barren wasteland (albeit a pretty one). I've tried to go and unlock all the towers but other than the first couple you come to they all seem to have something that'll stop me, I'll get one shotted repeatedly then just end up either turning the game off or transporting back to somewhere I've already been. 

I'm not ready to give up yet because everything I've heard about the game is the sort of things I like but at the moment I'm just kind of stuck in a rut. Is there a town I should head to to get some more side quests going? Even where I've been so far it doesn't seem like there are many. Grinding out the shrines doesn't really appeal to me as I dont particularly enjoy them and having to do four just to get one more heart seems like a lot of effort. I thought I remembered something about a little house you got and could decorate yourself, how do I get involved in that? Basically any advice on a direction I should be going to get a bit more progress would be great.

I think the reason is because it basically works the same way an FPS works with ammo. Weak weapons are your generic pistol or rifle ammo, while more powerful weapons are your rocket launcher or BFG ammo. You use the weaker stuff for chaff and bust out the big guns for tough fights. 

When you think about it like this, it almost seems silly to get upset when weapons break. It's no different from running out of ammo for a certain gun and needing to switch to a different one.",,22,,28,,public

The story is a lot darker, and has super likable and interesting characters, that you spend the whole game with. And the world is super interesting. Feels like this could’ve been a series cause of the mythology. And the gameplay is like A Link to The Past, but isometric. Even if you don’t like isometric games, try this.

zelda,[SS] A theory on the time travel of Skyward Sword,False,7,0,"This is a theory that has been floating around in my head for a while now, so I thought that I would post it and get some feedback.

The time travel in Skyward Sword always bothered me. When analyzed using common time travel mechanics or the established conventions of the Zelda series, it just didn't add up, and created loads of continuity issues. Well, I believe that I have the answer to the question of 'how does time travel work in Skyward Sword?'. I have several pieces of evidence to prove this, and intend to justify my theory based on my knowledge of the game. If there are any flaws to my theory and logic, please feel free to point them out. Any alternative explanations to this issue are also welcome!

To understand the time mechanics of Skyward Sword we must understand how the gates of time function. From what we can observe, when activated, the gates join up two points in time that appear to move simultaneously, allowing for travel to and from the past. This is pretty obvious, as otherwise we would have multiple Links all popping in and out at the same time. It also goes in line with the plot, as during the time in which Link is powering up the master sword in the present, Zelda and Impa in the past are traveling from the temple of time to the sealed temple. It is also clear that changes in the past produce changes in the present, as evidenced through Link planting the life tree seedling in the past and it then having grown and matured in the present. This discounts the form of time travel in which all the actions taken by time travelers already happened, leading to no change in the future. (But more on that later).

The issues arise when we begin considering other forms of time travel known throughout the Zelda series and fiction. The most common form of time travel, in which changes in the past produce changes in the present, doesn't work as if it was the case, several continuity issues would arise. Near the end of the game, Demise is killed by Link wishing on the triforce, and Zelda awakens from her slumber. Girahim then kidnaps her, returns to the past, and uses her to resurrect Demise, or revitalize him, since he technically isn't dead at that time. He is subsequently defeated and sealed in the Master sword by Link. This would then mean that he would have been dead the whole time and that the events of the game would have been entirely unnecessary, as Demise would have been dead. It creates a grandfather paradox. Of course, this theoretical scenario contradicts what we see at the end of the game, as Link, Zelda and Groose return to a world in which the events of the game have still transpired, and Demise was killed by the triforce wish.

One might try to explain this with an alternate timeline theory, suggesting that when Link killed Demise in the past he created an alternate timeline in which he was defeated long before the game begins. But Link and Zelda still return to their own present, the one in which most of the game takes place, and there is nothing to suggest that the gates of time allow for travel between alternate timelines. So what's the deal then?

My theory is an altered version of the second form of time travel I mentioned, the one in which changes in the past produce changes in the present. I believe that this is still the case. However, the mechanics around it are different. This idea revolves around a known mechanic of the gates of time, the alignment of past and present to run simultaneously. When there is an active time in existence, the past and the present begin to run simultaneously. It is my belief that due to this, changes in the past affect the present, but without changing the time in between them. Allow me to explain.

Picture this:a rock sits on a blank surface. In the present it is in one position. In the past it was a few meters to the left, and during the time in between it moved a few meters to the right to end up where it is presently. How it moved is of no consequence. Then, a gate of time is opened. A person, we will call them P, goes back in time and moves the rock from its original position in the past even further to the left. In the present, this would of course cause the rock to be moved further left. Yet the time in between these two points remains unchanged, the rock still having moved from its original position in the past to its original position in the present. If P were to have watched the rock for a while in the present, then this would not change that fact, they still would have watched it move. When P moves it in the past reality in the present is rewritten to account for the rock's movement, but the time in between doesn't change. Yet the past and the present remain changed. I hope that makes sense.

So how does this apply to Skyward Sword, and does it account for the time travel? To answer this question, we must look at all the main instances of time travel within the game. There are four of these instances in the main story of the game, so there isn't too much to work with.

1)Impa and Zelda to the past, using the gate at the temple of time. (Gate one)

2)Link to the past, after having activated gate two with the Master sword.

3)Link to the past with the fruit of life, in order to grow the tree of life and heal the Thunder Dragon. Using gate two of course.

4)Girahim, Zelda, Link and Groose to the past using gate two, in which the game's final battle takes place.

It is important to note that I have discounted any instances of traveling to the present from the past, as this has no consequence on the continuity of Skyward Sword, which is what is being discussed here.

**Instance one**

Early on in the game, Zelda and Impa travel through gate one and into the past. I won't explain the details of this event, since it is unnecessary. Go and watch a video on the story of Skyward Sword if you must. But it is the consequences of this event that are of concern. Zelda and Impa end up in the past, and gate one is destroyed by whatever Sheikah bomb Impa used. This is interesting, because it means that there are no active gates of time in the world, with gate two still being deactivated until Link remedies that. I believe that this causes the effects of the time travel to work differently, as the past and present are no longer aligned. The first form of time travel that I mentioned earlier (remember that I said it would later be relevant) is what I believe then occurs. This is supported by the fact that Zelda can be seen in her sealed crystal at the very beginning of the game, when you first descend to the surface, if you look through a crack in the back doors of the sealed temple. This obviously tells as that Zelda is therefore destined to go and seal herself in the crystal, and that doing this in the past does not change the present as it had already happened in the timeline nonetheless. I think that this is what happens when there are no active gates of time in existence, that the actions taken in the past become part of the timeline that the present results from.

**Instance two**

Later on, after having tempered the Master sword in the three sacred flames, Link uses it to activate gate two in the sealed temple. This then means that there is an active gate of time in existence, and that the previous form of time travel that I have established, the one in which actions in the past affect the present without changing the time in between, is reinstated. I won't explain the full detail of events, but Zelda ends up sealing herself in the crystal to maintain Demise's seal nonetheless. Considering the way in which the gates of time operate, aligning the past and present, this would be ineffective as Zelda would only appear in the crystal in the present, and the time in between would not have changed. This of course does not add up with what we literally see. However, it is most likely that in the original version of events that took place before Link activated gate two and returned to the past, that Zelda sealed herself in the crystal without their encounter taking place, and began her long slumber. As the time in between the past and the present does not change in my proposed form of time travel (which I will refer to as mechanic one, with the other that takes effect when no gates of time are active being mechanic two), the aforementioned problem created by mechanic one is nullified, as Zelda is maintaining the seal anyway.

**Instance three**

In instance three, Link returns to the past, having gathered the life tree seedling, in order to plant it in the past, grow a life tree, and harvest the life tree fruit in order to heal the Thunder Dragon. Mechanic one is in line with this, as planting the life tree seedling in the past would cause there to be a fully grown life tree in the present. Now, if changes to the past altered the entire timeline, then the tree would have always been there, which it is not. Groose also reacts to the tree's sudden appearance, suggesting that it appeared in the present when Link planted it in the past. This further supports my theory.

**Instance four**

Now here is where things start to get interesting. After having destroyed Demise in the present, Zelda is freed from her slumber but before they can all celebrate, Girahim kidnaps her and returns to the past in order to revitalize Demise whilst he is still alive. This of course eventually results in Demise's defeat. With mechanic one in play, we can conclude that there is no consequence to this, as Demise was already dead in the present, meaning that his death in the past does not produce any result. However, there are more important things to mention. Before returning to the present, Link plants the Master sword in the pedestal, putting it and Fi to rest. This of course would cause it to appear in the present, without any changes being made to the rest of the timeline in between, which does not mess with the game's established continuity. Now, there is the matter of Impa's, or should I say, Zelda's bracelet. Before returning to the present, Zelda gives Impa the bracelet. According to mechanic one, this would cause Impa to have it in the present, but before that we saw her with the bracelet when we first encountered her in the sealed temple after having first descended from Skyloft. So, what gives? Well, remember mechanic two, and how it came into effect after gate one was destroyed? I think that before sealing herself in the original timeline, before Link went to the past and changed it, that Zelda gave Impa the bracelet, same as we see in the cutscene before they return to the future in our version of events. So, like with Zelda's sealing of herself after the opening of gate two, this does not change anything. I admit, this is not guaranteed to have happened, but I realized this as a potential flaw whilst writing, and this is the only way that I can explain it. But there is not evidence against it happening either. With this explanation, my theory still works.

Once Zelda, Link and Groose return to the present, Impa in the past destroys gate two, eliminating the last gate of time from existence. I think that the effects of mechanic one's existence are not erased because of this, as they still happened whilst the gate was still active. But now that both gates are destroyed, time travel is no longer possible, meaning that no further explanations of continuity issues are required. Yay for me!

I have now provided all the evidence for my theory and why I believe that it explains the convoluted time travel in Skyward Sword. If you made it to the end of this post, then I congratulate you. It is very long, and I understand that it is quite a lot to explain time travel in one of the Zelda games, and that some might not be concerned with that. But I wanted to post it, to get it out of my system, and to potentially give any others an interesting read and an explanation for something that might have bugged them after having played Skyward Sword.

Thank you for reading, if you did. I hope my words make sense. feel free to comment for clarification, or to challenge my theory and maybe provide alternative arguments. As I said at the start, all are welcome!",,15,,7,,public

1 year ago, I gave myself the challenge to 100% any of the mainline Zelda games and document it on reddit. Having beaten the first 4 games one year ago, after some time I decided to pick up the challenge again and start playing OoT and Majoras Mask.

I will jump straight to the rating and my own opinion :)

# The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

This game is really a masterpiece. It all started here, in my opinion. I would suggest every zelda interested person to 100% this game. The sound design really was the cherry on top. I really love playing games and just getting lost in the tunes. One of my favourites beeing the spirit temple and market music. It just slaps.

The game breaking the 2D barrier and dipping into the world of 3D is really unparalleled in my opinion.

The deeply involving storyline paired with the intuitive controls and an overall great experience makes this game one of the best if not the best game ever developed.

Rating: 100/100 a literal masterpiece

# The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask

The game has probably one of the hardest tasks ever given to a videogame: beeing the sucessor of OoT. The game still manages to be a great game. In my opinion, it is not equal to OoT. The game lacks ""pace"" at the start of the game. It starts off really slow. The 3-day schedule really inspired my creativity. Boundaries are set at the start of the game, and you have the rest of the game to get comfortable with it. I really loved exploring every nook and cranny to get information on new missions. Without the bombers notebook this game would be a nightmare.

The music is really well made. One of the best tracks is the astral observatory.

The game was hard at some places. I needed to google some clues in order to get the game at 100%.

Rating: 95/100 (-5 points for the lack of pace at the start of the game)

zelda,[WW] Am I just bad at this game?,False,19,0,"For some background, I bought Wind Waker HD in June 2020 and have been playing it extremely sporadically since; I picked it up for the first time in 6-12 months a couple nights ago. The Zelda games I’ve played through are SS, OoT 3D, TP HD,  and BoTW, in that order, and I am the type of player that likes to explore things that are not part of the main quest; I would never collect 900 korok seeds, but I did all 120 shrines and all of Trial of the Sword.

So in Wind Waker I was stuck on how to get into the Earth and Wind Temples. The red dragon boat told me that I should ask for help from “those in the seas nearby” or something like that, and I assumed that meant the people living on nearby islands, so I went to Windfall Island and of course found nothing to help me. I eventually gave up and consulted a guide, which said needed to shoot a cyclone guy to get fire and ice arrows and then use the arrows to access the fire and ice islands, and I previously had no idea any of those even existed, let alone where to find them. The only other time I’ve felt this confused at how I was supposed to figure out how to do something in a Zelda game was when I played OoT and had to look up how to get inside Jabu-Jabu’s belly. So naturally I was curious at how the game meant for players to figure it out, and I realized that I had never learned there were fish people literally in the sea around each island that I could talk to.  I’ve never figured out how the treasure maps work either, and according to the guide I am supposed to have 16 hearts by now but I only have 6 or 7. I’d heard Wind Waker was supposed to be one of the easier and more enjoyable games, but clearly I’ve been missing a lot of things while playing.

Game #6: Majora's Mask 3D

Once again, this post came late because I was playing through Xenoblade Chronicles 3 for 6 weeks.  On the bright side, I beat Majora's Mask in only 2 weeks, so I made pretty good time!

Majora's Mask is a game of ups and downs for me.  The atmosphere of this game is phenomenal—the different reactions to the impending moon crash from all the characters made it interesting to talk to everybody you could find.  Also, the dungeons are top notch.  Stone Tower Temple has one of the coolest dungeon gimmicks in any Zelda game and the others are no slouch.  Just a shame there was only three of them!

Expanding on the masks from OoT was a lot of fun and there were a handful that were pretty useful.  The Bunny Hood probably got the most use, but I wanted to shout out the Blast Mask as a clever use of game design.  Start the 3-day cycle and out of bombs?  No problem, just put this mask on!  Of course, the three transformational masks were great and probably the most memorable thing about this game.  On the flip side, there were a ton of masks that did nothing except get me a heart piece or two and that's kind of boring.

Now, for the cons.  The big one for me is the bosses in this game.  Quite frankly, aside from the Goht fight that was a lot of fun, they were either lame or frustrating.  The remake's attempts to make the fights more interesting didn't really help.  Trying to corral Gyorg towards the mines was frustrating; meanwhile, somehow the Twinmold fight was far slower in the giant form than just with the bow (though I did waste a boulder on doing absolutely nothing).  Also of frustration were the events tied to beating the boss of an area.  Sure, being able to fight the bosses again *voluntarily* is cool, but needing to fight the same boss multiple times because you couldn't quite get all the goodies of that area before you ran out of time was annoying.  Thank God I didn't have to fight Twinmold a second time.

All in all, I guess my biggest takeaway from Majora's Mask is that I wish there were more of the things it did incredibly well at: the dungeons!  The side quests were neat, and the Bombers' Notebook did a great job of keeping track of them all, but it was more than half the content.  I still had a good time of course, it's just that Majora's Mask is a game leaving me wanting more.

Next up is Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.  I suppose I'll probably do one post for them combined, but rank them separately.  They're intertwined, but still different games after all.

zelda,[ALL] Are the top knights in Zelda games Lycanthropes?,False,10,0,"I've thought about this for about 5 minutes and would love to hear what everyone else's idea for it might be, but I think the best of the best regarding the knights in hyrule are actually lycanthropes, either in blood or bestowed it onto them. In TP we see link become a wolf, it is said that it is because he holds the triforce of courage and he didn't merely become a spirit in the twilight like the others did, but that's just the start of it. Later on we see the heroes shade which is canonically OOT link as a wolf, he can transform between each form at will, he is wearing armor similarly to a darknut, same height as well and they're all well versed in multiple fighting styles, switching to a faster paced style with quicker weapons when their armor is removed.

In wind waker the darknuts in that are humanoid but also canine, they wear a knights crest, one only given to someone who shows amazing ability and courage, we also see them fighting the moblins in hyrule castle, they're also well equipped with multiple fighting styles. So with all of that we can really see that wolf-like creatures can be tied to the royal family and are only seen among the top fighters.

But also there is another werewolf-like enemy we tend to see in zelda games, the wolfos, theyre enemies that are usually seen just wandering around, have no real agency and are hellbent on attacking anything it sees, it runs on all fours, attacks with fists blindly and acts more feral, theyre also the first enemies we see guarding the entrance to the forest temple, a place with ties to the royal family, could it just be that those were predicted to be top knights who couldn't handle being turned into a werewolf and lost their composure?

They also appear in random locations as well like grottos guarding nothing related to the royal family, and in MM theyre just random enemies that appear at night out of nowhere, so that could just be entirely unrelated and I'm thinking too much into it, but thinking too much into it is the fun part i say. Another kind of more reaching theory I have for why the darknuts in TP aren't canines is that they're husks possessed by ganon with no spirit, and as we can see with the heroes shade, the lingering spirit is what holds that ability, not the body itself, and we only ever see darknuts in old, abandoned or taken over places like the old temple of time, hyrule castle post-ganon, and the trial rooms in gerudo desert.

So what do you guys think? Why is there so much connection between werewolf/wolf-like entities when it comes to the best of the best for the royal families? Either way, all this really made me do was want an MM sequel that shows what link did between the events of MM and TP, how he learned the skills he did and what ultimately ended him and made him into what he became, I think there'd be a lot to show how he got there and his feelings of lingering regret that he felt from not being able to truly pass on his skills that he learned and had to give up, but I personally couldn't really see nintendo make such a game and have it be done in a satisfying way that ties both games together.

TLDR: The best knights in Zelda games have been related to wolves in some form. I spent only a few minutes thinking about it and I thought it was a fun speculation, some of the things I point to are not consistent between games and could just simply be a reach, but that's the fun of it to me, and I would like to hear what others think as well.",,3,,10,,public

zelda,[ToTK] Another Tears of the Kingdom Theory (Skyward Sword Spoilers),False,1,0,"So I had a thought. The Ouroboros in the title has to mean something. A lot of people think that the figure at the start of the trailer is the Goddess Hylia. People are also saying that there are a lot of references to Skyward Sword. My theory is that the just like how the battle between Ganondorf and Link is endless return (the meaning of Ouroboros) and the world of The Legend of Zelda undergoes the same process.

So at the beginning of SS it says ""One dark, fateful day, the earth cracked wide and malevolent forces rushed forth from the fissure."" The ground cracked and Hyrule castle rose from it. It also says ""The goddess gathered the surviving humans on an outcropping of earth. She sent it skyward, beyond the reach of the demonic hordes. Beyond even the clouds."" This outcropping could be made at the end of ToTK.

So if you haven't caught on yet I'm thinking that the end of ToTK is the beginning of SS. Also the master sword is broken so it might have all it's power drained from it and it might revert back to the goddess sword. So in conclusion my theory is that the ToTK is the last game in the timeline (not the last Legend of Zelda game) and at the same time is set before SS.

**Edit:** For those that don't like this theory, this does not mean they wont make anymore Zelda games. They can still put new games at any point in the timeline. The adult and child timeline still only have three games in them. ",,6,,1,,public

zelda,[TP] I Restarted Twilight Princess After 10+ Years...,False,22,0,"...And I love it. It's really, really cool. I'm barely an hour in but I feel immersed into the story, characters and setting. Ordon Village is a gorgeous jewel and feels intimate being surrounded by the trees and mountains on all sides. The game's artstyle is pretty to look at: Link's home is incredibly cozy with all the light rays piercing through the ceiling and windows. There are many books and pens as well meaning that Link likes to read and write. Perhaps Link wrote some of the books here, making stories for the children habiting the village. I loved hearing the sounds of the forest when you first go search for Epona, it feels peaceful and meditative.

I found a precious puppy in one of the villager's home who was very very happy to see me. The tail was wagging and it wanted to lick my face. Good god this is the best game ever, you can actually CARRY the puppy ! I put the dog on the table and looked in first person making its big snout fill up my screen. I pretended to kiss it on the snout then went away after struggling to step out the door. It was just so happy to see me.

I enjoyed exploring the village in search of rupees to buy the Slingshot. And what a powerful tool it is ! It just exploded a scarecrow's pumpkin head just as if I shot at it with a cannonball !

The combat seems a lot more focused on Swordplay than Breath of the Wild. I appreciate you can swing your sword in different directions in a smooth and epic way. The hits also feel powerful.

And god did they make Link handsome in this game. No wonder they keep him away from the big town, dude would be a superstar of handsomeness there and his ego would go through the roof.

If anything goes wrong, perhaps it's because the villain is jealous that Link is so pretty.

I am feeling just so hyped to go to Hyrule: the game does a great job hyping you up for the trip and that's where I will go soon. But I have the feeling it's not going to go so well...

So yeah, I really, really enjoy the beginning of Twilight Princess. Some people think it's too slow, but I feel like it's setting the story really well and I'm actually sad it may not go like this for longer...

zelda,[MC] The Minish Cap is one of the most solid games I've ever played in a handheld console. How do you feel about it?,False,410,0,"I haven't beat it yet, but oh boy, the graphics and animations are impecable, the music is beautiful, the story so far is lovely and the mechanics and power-ups are well-achieved. The puzzles are perfectly balanced between fun and challenging and even though it has its flaws like the kinstone's mechanic (NPCs are too scatered through the map and that makes it difficult to find the correct ones) the game compensates them very well. I've only been playing this game for a day, but I played like, 4 hours non-stop, I felt almost addicted to it. I haven't felt this way since I played A Link Between Worlds many years ago, now I'm really optimistic about owning Link's Awakening for my Nintendo Switch.

zelda,[TotK] [BotW] Theory: Could the Leviathans within BotW hold larger significance in TotK?,False,59,0,"In BOTW, there exists gigantic skeletons of creatures referred to as ""Leviathans"". There are three leviathan skeletons in total, found at completely different areas in hyrule. There is one in Hebra, one in the Gerudo Desert, and one behind Death Mountain. So far, the only creatures who match their size are the three dragons. These dragons are able to be observed flying high above the clouds, and if you shoot any of them with arrows, they will make their way to a sort of portal high in the sky, after which they completely disappear.
Could this portal be one to the sky kingdom? Now, from the anatomy of the leviathans, we can assume that they were also capable of flight. This is a very important feature of the leviathans' anatomy that ties into this theory.

Why are these leviathans here? Where did they come from? And why are they so blatantly riddled across the map? (With the exception of the Hebra leviathan) And just how old are they exactly? This question has been raised many times throughout the lifespan of botw's theory community. From what we know, they were considered ancient well before the calamity.

After the new trailer we recently received during the nintendo direct, some have pointed out that there seems to be a sort of dragon-like creature hidden behind one of the sky islands, as we can see what appears to be a tail of sorts. Some have also pointed out that it doesn't seem to belong to any of the known dragons of hyrule. See where I'm going with this?

Some have theorized that we will be traveling back in time during the main story of TotK, to the great war thousands of years in the past. I am unsure if this is the case, but for the sake of this theory, I will consider this a possibility. If the sky Islands were a thing of the past, as many speculate, than could this dragon-esque creature be one of the leviathans? Could the leviathans have existed during this long-forgotten time? And if so, could the leviathans play a bigger role in the larger narrative? Perhaps they could play a similar role to the dragons in botw. But why, then, are they dead? Are they just normal creatures that existed alongside the ancient civilizations, unlike the dragons who represent the goddeses?",,10,,59,,public

God damn, something about this game's presentation just strike me some type of way. This game literally just feels like the happiest part of my childhood. It gives me the feeling of when I used to explore the massive woods that surrounded my small Pennsylvanian childhood home. The green leaves from the vegetation, the blue sky above dotted with clouds, and the somber pleasant breeze. Wind Waker just brings back all of those pure feelings that I had when I was a kid who'd go on imaginary adventures in the woods, swinging a big stick around like a sword.

Again, I never played this game when I was a kid, so these feelings don't come from association. The only other game I've ever vibed with on this level is Little Nightmares 2. Funnily enough, it's because that game made me feel things from my childhood too. I didn't have many friends when I was a little kid, so I did feel lonely and isolated a lot, and where I lived it stormed and rained constantly. Many days were overcast and dark. So whenever I play LN2 I get the feelings of calmness and somberness from my youth, and when I play the WW I feel my former upbeat happiness and sense of adventure.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way about Wind Waker, I know a lot of people still don't even like it's art style. But I just can't stop having these pure feelings of bliss whenever I play it.",,111,,1267,,public

zelda,[TotK] ganon being the ancient hero wouldnt make much sense,False,2,0,"Now ever since the tears of the kingdom new trailer (and the first gameplay one) people assumed long haired link would be the hero 10,000 years ago aka ganondorf would require a new seperate timeline created before OOT simply because the spirit of demise already inhabited ganondorf meanwhile the spirit of link posses a new hylian boy each time and its always a fair skinned (mostly) blonde hylian young adult who is the only person able to wield the master sword while demise took the rare gerudo male king that pops every 100 years 

Now for ganondorf to be the ancient hero he would need the master sword and as we see only the one who posses the spirit of the hero can wield the master swor meanwhile the incarnation of demise would get obliterated by the blade

So after this info there are 2 solutions and bith of them require a 4th timeline before oot, eithe A) in this world instead of the hero incarnating as a young hylian boy he for some reason chose the gerudo king meanwhile demise staying for thousands of years without a body becomes so angry he manifests malice and the calamity with his original body being sealed in the master sword but that doesnt explain the corpse we see in the first trailer unless its somehow twilight princess ganon, i believe eijy aunuma(i butchered his name ik) said that botw its way later in the timeline after it fused and now we have 2 ganondorfs, 1 is the twilight princess ganon since he is the only one of the 3 timelines who still had his body intact, and the ganondorf that is an incarnation of the hero 10k years ago",,7,,2,,public

zelda,[TotK] Theory Explaining Who The Long-Eared Deity Is That's Shown In The New TotK Trailer,False,0,0,"WARNING - Post Might Contain Possible Spoilers!!! 


The deity looking figure, shown in the newest TotK trailer, looks like a scaled up Minish/Picori character that is presented like a deity. In the Minish Cap the opening sequence tells the story of ""The Hero of Men"" where the Minish/Picori gift the Light Force and Picori Blade to that iteration of Link. The Wind Tribe also lived in the lands above Hyrule, as depicted in the Minish Cap as well. The BotW and TotK Game Director, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, was also the game director and writer for The Minish Cap.

In TotK, Link appears to repair the Master Sword with the help of the Light Force. The stone relief carving of Zelda and the deity figure making a circle with their hands show their connection of using the Light Force. Since the Picori and Zelda are both known wielders/users of the Light Force, it makes sense the game developers would create lore around this concept.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting TotK is the full story of The Hero of Men that the Minish Cap briefly mentions. I'm suggesting inspiration surrounding the lore about The Hero of Men heavily influenced the TotK's story. That, and I'm suggesting the long-eared deity is a depiction of a Picori/Minish deity, which Zelda and the deity share a connection via the Light Force.

Bonus Theory: The eye with three lashes pointing down, that is heavily depicted in TotK, is similar to the Sheikah eye symbol because the triangles on the Sheikah eye point up to purposely signal up to the lands above hyrule, and vice versa for the lands above Hyrule. I would guess this would be another way to depict the in-game historical importance of the two lands connection with each other.

So, there you have it. You now know who the deity is and why there seems to be an important connection between this Picori deity and Zelda.

zelda,"[TotK] [MC] Theory: The Zonai ""mysteriously disappeared"" by raising their tribe, and palace to the sky. They are serving their ""greater purpose"" by lowering back down and will be key in saving Hyrule. The Zonai are the Wind Tribe from MC",False,54,0,"Doing some digging for clues about the Zonai, I came across [this image](https://i.imgur.com/sWhVBPX.jpg) from 'The Minish Cap' which shows not only a Darknut clad in armour with the serpents/dragons that are associated with the Zonai, but a huge building in the background which is a dungeon called 'The Palace of Winds'. In digging around a little more, I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/o4kb8p/botw2_speculation_are_the_zonai_based_on_the_wind/) from a year ago which goes much more in depth about the [Wind Tribe](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Tribe) whom the palace belongs to. If you don't want to check it out, the Wind Tribe are people who once lived on the surface, but using magic they have ascended with their palace into the skies in order to protect it.

To strengthen the relationship between the Zonai and the Wind Tribe, the [Wind Tribe](https://i.imgur.com/KW5G3cE.png) uses the a [swirl](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/e/eb/TMC_Home_of_the_Wind_Tribe.png/revision/latest?cb=20200905200837&amp;format=original) and keeps the [Wind Element](https://i.imgur.com/R9ZFAYI.png) in their palace which is the same shape, much like the Zonai have on [their ruins](https://i.imgur.com/3Mxpouj.jpg). They also left [ruins](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Ruins#The_Minish_Cap) which are in the jungle area of the [Castor Wilds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/3/3b/TMC_Castor_Wilds.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20091204161738&amp;format=original). Possibly the most significant is the symbol on the center of [this platform](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/494636104612315146/1020323304243998740/TMC_Fortress_of_Winds_5.png.jpg) made by the Wind Tribe bears a tremendous resemblance to [the final shot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/494636104612315146/1019265881156636712/unknown.png) in the last trailer where two ""tears"" are in the same circle.

Some quotes from the Wind Tribe to further convince you:

&gt;"" *The people who built the Wind Ruins (Zonai ruins?). They now live above the clouds, suspended by their own magic ability to control the wind.* ""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*Although we are of the Wind Tribe, we, too, once lived on the surface. Once, the place you call the Wind Ruins was, to us, a home.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*Our tribe abandoned the place you call the* *Wind Ruins... With our magic, we moved our palace up into the skies. We are the* *Wind Tribe.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;""*In this tower dwell the people of the Wind Tribe. We left your surface world long ago to serve a greater duty. We now protect the gate to the Palace of Winds, where the Wind Element lies.*""

[This massive structure](https://i.imgur.com/uRDyYVE.png) that keeps appearing in the trailers I believe might have something to do with the Wind Tribe/Zonai. When the Zonai are said to have ""myseriously disappeared"" they might be referring to when the Wind Tribe took their palace and Tribe to the sky. So this structure might actually be the palace lower down closer to the ground so that they can *serve their greater duty*.

Their greater duty I believe might be watching over Hyrule and only intervening when they know that the world will end as we know it. We know they are able to know what is going on, on the surface since:

&gt;*""The leader of the Wind Tribe knows everything happening on the surface by listening to rumors carried by the wind.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;and ""*We have been watching, and we know all that happens on your surface world. We know a small boy collects* *elements* *to lift the curse from a princess. We know of* *Vaati* *and his evil acts... The winds tell us these things.*""

I also believe the islands that we see in the trailers aren't risen from the ground, but they actually are being lowered with the structure as well. It wouldn't make much sense to me if they were raised up, since the ruins on them aren't visible to us in BotW.

Oh, and all of them have red hair and are definitely all Groose's descendants.

Another theory that is definitely a stretch, but a fun one:

Artifacts of the Wind Tribe might be present in Skyward Sword as well. A robot called [Mazaal](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/a/af/TMC_Mazaal_Sprite.png/revision/latest?cb=20180927225542&amp;format=original) was created to defend the Fortress of Winds in 'The Minish Cap' so they were not only skilled with magic, but with technology as well. Mazaal look very much like [Gohdan](https://i.imgur.com/GD10jXn.jpg) as well, and has a design much more similar to the Zonai that we know from BotW. Keeping in mind the [colour of their clothing](https://i.imgur.com/KW5G3cE.png) and the colour of Mazaal, the Wind Tribe seems to like the colours red and blue. The ancient robots in Lanayru, for example the [Scrapper](https://i.imgur.com/rVSHisU.jpg), [Armos](https://i.imgur.com/tns3jN7.jpg) and [Beamos](https://i.imgur.com/hDzRCjv.jpg) have a similar colour scheme to them, so they might have been made by the Wind Tribe while they were living on the surface. The Beamos, though having many different iterations over all the games, looks quite similar to this concept art of a [Guardian Turret](https://i.imgur.com/WgWKM88.jpg) and [this Beamos](https://i.imgur.com/BpM1YBb.png) from TP might even have the Zonai swirl on around its head.

The Mining Facility in Lanayru is very different from what the Zonai design is in BotW, but since it's in the desert it's not unreasonable to think that it is just very deep underground due to the thousands of years being in a desert. Maybe due to more caves opening up in TotK this area might reveal itself again. As well, due to the facility mining [Timeshift Stones](https://i.imgur.com/1MKyu0e.png) which look extremely similar to these [Giant Columns](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda_gamepedia_en/images/0/08/BotW_Giant_Column_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20210621071522) that the Guardians were said to have come out of, they might just be from extremely ancient Sheikah tech. Or what I would prefer: the Zonai, Wind Tribe and Sheikah are related.

They are planning to  TOTK 5/23 on Switch

They are going to release a new console around 3/24 with TOTk being one of the first titlegames

And then later, you have to go find the Loftwing and rescue it from its trap that Groose made. In other words, you can actually see Groose and the other two chasing after the bird in the opening cutscene and I think it's super cool that they gave a little easter egg to later events in the game.",,6,,172,,public
zelda,[LA] New Glitch / Memory Exploit get photos early Link's Awakening DX,False,38,0,"I've accidentally discovered a way to unlock photos early in Link's Awakening, and, if researched more, it may be possible to unlock the ""Steal from Shop"" photo without causing your name to be changed to THIEF.

It started as I was farming enemies for a piece of power and I unexpectedly suddenly had the Red Tunic from the color dungeon. This is an already-known memory overflow glitch which I executed by accident, if you don't know about it, it's detailed here: [https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches\_in\_Link%27s\_Awakening#Obtaining\_Colored\_Tunics\_Without\_Visiting\_the\_Color\_Dungeon\_(Including\_Extra\_%22Damage\_Sprite\_Tunic%22)](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches_in_Link%27s_Awakening#Obtaining_Colored_Tunics_Without_Visiting_the_Color_Dungeon_(Including_Extra_%22Damage_Sprite_Tunic%22))

However, as I paused the game to see yep, I have the red tunic, I also saw my photo count - it said I had 1 out of 12 photos. I hadn't been to the camera guy yet. So curious, I went to the camera guy, got my photo taken... and now it says have 2 out of 12 photos. I inspected the album, and found that in addition to the starting photo, I also had the Zora-At-the-Pond photo, which is impossible, since I only finished the first dungeon.

I've tried to reproduce this and I'm not sure how. Somehow the enemy count memory exploit can do more than just change your tunic - it can unlock photos too! So I'm wondering - the most annoying photo in LA is one that forces you to choose between keeping your name or having full photo completion. With this exploit, if exact details get figured out, you might be able finish the album and keep your name.

I've tried to search online and can't find any other detail of unlocking photos using this memory glitch. Does anyone have any detailed knowledge of this? Or know where I could go to find people who do?

The only thing I was doing differently from the tunic glitch is I had Bow Wow with me so he was eating enemies at the same time which made it hard to farm the exact number of baddies.",,2,,38,,public

zelda,[ALL] Is Ocarina of Time still the most accessible game in the series?,False,2,0,"Hey guys, wanted to get a quick discussion going since I've been thinking about this for a while.

Regarding every mainline game in the series from LoZ to BotW, is Ocarina of Time the one that we as fans could easily say is the best one to get people into the series with? Disregarding superfluous stuff like  ""le hecking 99 on metacritic best game of all time!!"" and all that. I was thinking of all the other 3D games in the series and LA/ALttP (imo LoZ and AoL just aren't worth it for newcomers) and OoT seems to be the one in my mind that makes the most sense to be someone's first.

* When I think of the other 3D Games, Majora's Mask is an instant no from me and not because of the quality (great game imo) but rather the sheer pressure the game puts you under to get stuff done.
* Wind Waker breaks from some traditions with the sailing and the endgame, particularly in the GC version, is never fun to go through again.
* Twlight Princess \[my personal fav Zelda\] is maybe a decent pick since it's ""Ocarina of Time...but bigger"" but its tone and mood are a heavy shift from most other games in the seires, plus there's that intro...
* Skyward Sword has the advantage of it being first game in the timeline but the controls could be a stickler for some. HD Version does improve this.
* BotW is another decent pick, but doesn't play like any other 3D Game in the series.

The above is just my opinion btw.

Some argue the weapon durability is annoying, I never minded it. For most people who said botw is the best one, I asked them what ones they played and it's always just botw as the only one they played. It just isn't enough Zelda for my liking. I did really enjoy this one but it doesn't deserve this. There isn't the wonder of entering a dungeon and knowing your gonna get a whole new item to play with. Botw doesn't do that, there is no new item in every dungeon. Some people prefer this, me personally, I don't. The bosses are just uncreative and lazy. It's not like other bosses where they all are different creatures with specific weak points, attacks and background storeys. Like with volvagia being a dragon contained inside the volcano, phantom Ganon being a puppet created by ganondorf or the wild pig Ganon in twilight princess.

Also, I hope I did the spoiler tagging and followed the rules correctly!

Some notes (spoilers ahead):
&gt;!-Technically, Triforce Heroes is officially placed after Link Between Worlds, and it can be there as well, but I just feel it works better after Spirit Tracks. Hytopia being a civilization near New Hyrule makes more sense to me.!&lt;
&gt;!-Majora's Mask, theoretically, would also have a split if we use my interpretation of bad endings being branches. I didn't include it because I couldn't fit it... even if I should have.!&lt;
&gt;!-Four Sword Adventures being a prequel to Link to the Past has a ton of evidence: it shows the origin of Ganondorf becoming ""Pig Wizard Ganon"" who steals a trident, introduces the concept of a Dark World, includes Maidens, and in the GBA Link to the Past, the Four Sword is present, broken into 4.!&lt;
&gt;!-The Broken Four Sword implies Ganon broke free of the seal and then sealed the Four Sword in the Dark World to avoid being sealed once more, unaware of the Master Sword.!&lt;
&gt;!-I made a note about this, but an argument CAN be made to move the ""Calamity Era"" events after Ganon is resurrected in Zelda 2's bad ending, but I personally prefer it to be where I have it.!&lt;
&gt;!-Final note... if you disagree, I would totally understand! The timeline doesn't really matter at the end of the day and is just fun to talk about.!&lt;

I’m slightly hung up on where to play OoT and MM on a TV though. 

I have both on my old Wii via Virtual Console, and have a wavebird controller. 

I also have Nintendo Online, ao can also access them on my Switch. I do not have a Switch N64 controller though.

zelda,[ALL] Game Ideas That I Thought I Would Share,False,2,0,"* **Hyrule Warriors: Civil War**
   * Between the Minish Cap and Ocarina of Time
   * Plays out the Hylian Civil War
   * Can follow Link's dad or really anybody in the Hylian Army at the time
   * No reason to exist besides to tell a compelling story, scratch that Zelda Warriors itch, and do the impossible task of being a canon Hyrule Warriors game, I don't care if it has to end with you losing to do so
* **The Legend of Zelda: The Hero Shade** ([link to where I got the name from](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/knzek4/oc_i_made_a_game_logo_for_the_heros_shade_id_love/))
   * Between Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess
   * Game could have a mix of large battles like the Warriors games, an evolving and active semi-open world like Marvel's Spiderman, some optional content that hits the ""we know what this is, Link knows what this is, but that's not how it played out in this timeline"" chord, cutscenes and graphics that make the story beats hit like if it was a movie, idk it's just an idea at the end of the day
   * Puts Link with Malon at Lon Lon Ranch and makes them the founders of Ordon Village sometime later, Link keeps some of his Majora's Mask gear (namely the shields, swords, very few of the masks, and everything that ultimately ends up in the hands of the Hero of Twilight)
   * King doesn't immediately get after Ganondorf, but 'Dorf kills him anyway after growing impatient, basically destroys OoT's Hyrule, and forces the Hylians to move to what would become Hyrule in Twilight Princess
   * Zelda tries to convince Link to get back into the fight, he declines, but goes back to the ruins of the Temple of Time anyway to get the Master Sword and slay this son of a sand worm. Again.
   * Sages get awakened and bosses that were never killed in the Child Timeline get on steroids but ultimately go down anyway
   * Link still needs to die in battle for the Hero Shade to look how he does so the game can end either with Link getting ambushed while returning the Master Sword OR having the last mission be a Halo: Reach situation where the only possible ending is your own death.
   * Sages would be like an RPG party and be forced to step in once the finishing blow is dealt on Link, capturing and trying to kill Ganondorf themselves since their hero can't.
   * Maybe throw in a post credit scene of the Hero of Twilight calling out to the Hero of Time via the Song of Healing
* **The Legend of Zelda: Cascade of Tears**
   * Between Ocarina of Time &amp; The Wind Waker
   * No hero, just Ganondorf, Ganon, and nobody that can stop certain demise
   * Play as the Sages and Zelda in one big Halo: Reach situation, switching between them to prepare the Kingdom of Hyrule for the flood that is to come
   * Maybe do a mix of large Warriors battles, an evolving and active semi-open world that changes as you hit certain story triggers, some optional content that instead hits the ""we know what this is, and Link would know what this is, but Link is gone and nobody knows what this is"" chord, idk
   * Dungeons that are built into the environment but where each environment isn't solely there to function as a big dungeon (like literally 97% of Skyward Sword). Imagine a decaying Kokiri Forest as the main environment but the crumbling Forest Temple holds a secret doodad and you have to solve riddles, complete ""side-quests"", etc. to clear a path within those ruins to your secret doodad and maybe a fight a boss that plays out in the main environment... or something
   * At some point early on it starts sprinkling, then raining, and the last mission is to evacuate as many as possible to high ground, where Wind Waker's intro plays out after that
   * Can be a bonus game like how OoT on the Gamecube was a bonus game for pre-ordering the Wind Waker (or something, idk my parents didn't love me)
* **The Legend of Zelda: Warriors of Time** ***OR TLoZ: Hyrule Warriors (203X)***
   * Careful re-telling of some of the story of the original Hyrule Warriors, some original story mixed in, some of the pre-game info given in the original HW, and generally enough story and explanation to serve as the single event that unifies the three timelines and ultimately makes Breath of the Wild and everything after it possible
   * Maybe have it start as a game set in the Abandoned (Downfall Timeline for you non-believers) after Zelda II, with Hyrule as a kingdom on the doorstep of extinction and without any other option but to use the Triforce's power, the combination of the Master Sword and the Funky Blue Ocarina, or even just a direct intervention by the gods to collapse spacetime into one unified timeline again
   * Maybe have it start as a game set in the Adult Timeline and set up their comparatively more advanced technology to eventually become Sheikah technology once the surviving Sheikah from the Child and Abandoned timelines get their hands on it, with multiple strange evil entities cornering New Hyrule into doing such a risky move like violating the laws of physics
   * Have your sorceresses open portals and smash alternate realities together, have Toon Link ride Epona while chasing Manhandla through Faron Woods, have your out-of-the-park fun with it, but just make sure that it stays as canon as possible and paves the way for the amount of timeline-defying stuff that's seen in Breath of the Wild
* **Hyrule Warriors: Reforged**
   * Multiplayer-focused combat game that lets you play on a wide variety of battlefields in a wide variety of key points in time from the history of The Legend of Zelda in one unifying artstyle
   * Simplest way to imagine it is to picture the modes of Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017) with the weapon and character variety of the original Hyrule Warriors, music that's on-par with orchestrated versions of Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, the openness of Breath of the Wild, and hopefully online servers that aren't being run on Windows 98.

zelda,"[OoT] gets better the more that you play it, and especially when you replay it as an adult",False,82,0,"
I first played OoT when I was about 13 on the 3DS. I remember enjoying it a lot, appreciating it for what it laid out for the series, and being really impressed by how well it held up to this day, but I wasn’t like floored by it. There was no arguing the soundtrack, the characters, the settings, the dungeons were all iconic, but having played a lot of the later titles first it felt a bit barebones. I was also 13 and didn’t give enough attention to it as it probably deserved; I basically speed ran through the temples.

I’ve been replaying it on the Switch and the game has just absolutely floored me. I went in this time knowing the basics, how to progress roughly, where to go, etc., and so spent a lot of time just fucking around and exploring. The amount of side content in this game that I just missed first time round is staggering. There are secrets literally everywhere. The world feels alive in a way that’s simply unbelievable for a game made when it was. Every single inch of it is so charming, every gameplay loop and area has so much thought out into it, the sense of progression from helpless kid to hero of Hyrule is pitch perfect.

And speaking of the kid to hero arc, playing again as an adult is like seeing the game with a whole new set of eyes. Underneath the kind of basic story is something really deep and profound, and it’s told mostly through gameplay. Namely, the loss of innocence that comes with becoming an adult. Until you get the master sword, all of Links adventures are kind of fairy tale like; he faces an obstacle, overcomes it, and moves on in the way a child just goes day to day, not worrying at the larger issues at play and failing to grasp what problems are a running theme in their own lives. Link might get the Kokiri’s Emerald, but the Deku Tree is dead. Dodongo’s Cavern might be open for business again, but the Gorons are sitting on top of a threat lurking right inside their mountain waiting to burst out. Jabu-Jabu and Princess Ruto might be saved, but the Zora’s home is soon about to be frozen over and Jabu-Jabu will vanish anyway.

Link, in his childhood naïveté, thinks he’s ‘fixing’ problems, but he’s merely applying bandages to bleeding wounds, all while following the exact path that Ganondorf has laid out for him and Zelda. It’s not until he becomes an adult, and finds the world isn’t what it seemed to be, and sees first hand the consequences of the events of his childhood, that it all becomes clear that this problem is far bigger than a fairy boy and a girl princess could ever have solved.

Link saves Hyrule, but he has to give up his childhood and his innocence to do it. I think the moment where you first leave the Temple of Time as an adult is one of the most effective moments in gaming history. The cheer and the fun and frivolity is over. Happy, bustling Castle Town is a ruin populated by the dead. This isn’t a fun little childhood fairy tale where the boy from the forest and the little princess overcome the big mean bad guy; the boy becomes an adult haunted by the past, the princess has to become a warrior and hide as her kingdom falls to ruins, and Ganondorf gets to live in ultimate power for years unchallenged. 

And even though Link returns to his child’s body, he’s no longer a child. He’s back in this happier world, but he knows the darkness that’s lurking under the surface, just waiting for a chance to strike and ruin everything. He’s been under the well. He’s seen castle town in ruins. He’s been horrified by the shadow temple. He’s watched Zora’s Domain freeze over, seen Death Mountain live up to his name, and in the very end he’s abandoned by his best friend, Navi, the one solid link to his childhood. The Kokiri stay childlike forever and are never without their fairies; Link is not a Kokiri, he’s no longer a child, and so Navi leaves him. He’s left there, alone, a child old before his time, who’s seen and sacrificed too much for a world that will never even know the best of it only exists because one child was forced to endure the worst it had to offer way too soon.",,23,,82,,public

By that I mean when Link fails in other games, evil has won definitely so time still goes on,  but you can't make games about it.

His in game model and artwork honestly makes him look fat; though that could possibly just be because of the heavy robes he's wearing. Ganondorf also appears to be very oddly proportioned, even for a Wind Waker character, his legs look almost comically stubby.  


Maybe Phantom Ganon is the closest we're ever gonna get to seeing what's underneath? Since Phantom Ganon is of course created in the image of the real Ganondorf, he's still got short legs, but not as stubby as normal Ganondorf's legs seem to be.

Don't know why i decided to replay one if my least favorite Zelda games, but i'm glad I did. I had such a cool experience this time, completely changed how I see this game and how It scores amongs the others.

PH it's so much fun and creative. Sure, it has its flaws, cof cof...Ocean King Temple.
But it got some of the best puzzles, treasure hunting, and bosses in the whole franchise. 

After doing the ""push the block on button"" thing in almost every Zelda, having to draw the map of a whale-island and look for its body parts for treasure was just so refreshing. For the first time in a while, i just didn't know what to expect when it comes to puzzle solving.
I mean, like you have to draw, scream on the mic, blow candles, even close the DS. I'd never thought i would see those logical Truth Tellers and Liars riddle again after high school. That was wild.

About how it could look: in my opinion is hard to imagine how would look like, but something sure is: the story would be totaly different, maybe they live in a society where things like deitys magic and monsters are just tales, but discovering that those stories were real.

And what i think the community will think: i dont know for sure, but i know that there will be 3 groups at least: the fans that liked the game, the ones that didnt like that Nintendo changed the style, and the ones that are really deep in the lore trying to fix the timeline (again).",,13,,5,hylian,public

zelda,[LoZ] Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask conclusion,False,85,0,"Hey r/zelda,

1 year ago, I gave myself the challenge to 100% any of the mainline Zelda games and document it on reddit. Having beaten the first 4 games one year ago, after some time I decided to pick up the challenge again and start playing OoT and Majoras Mask.

I will jump straight to the rating and my own opinion :)

# The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

This game is really a masterpiece. It all started here, in my opinion. I would suggest every zelda interested person to 100% this game. The sound design really was the cherry on top. I really love playing games and just getting lost in the tunes. One of my favourites beeing the spirit temple and market music. It just slaps.

The game breaking the 2D barrier and dipping into the world of 3D is really unparalleled in my opinion.

The deeply involving storyline paired with the intuitive controls and an overall great experience makes this game one of the best if not the best game ever developed.

Rating: 100/100 a literal masterpiece

# The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask

The game has probably one of the hardest tasks ever given to a videogame: beeing the sucessor of OoT. The game still manages to be a great game. In my opinion, it is not equal to OoT. The game lacks ""pace"" at the start of the game. It starts off really slow. The 3-day schedule really inspired my creativity. Boundaries are set at the start of the game, and you have the rest of the game to get comfortable with it. I really loved exploring every nook and cranny to get information on new missions. Without the bombers notebook this game would be a nightmare.

The music is really well made. One of the best tracks is the astral observatory.

The game was hard at some places. I needed to google some clues in order to get the game at 100%.

Rating: 95/100 (-5 points for the lack of pace at the start of the game)

The next 2 games are the Oracle of ... games.

zelda,[ALL] Updating a chart for Getting into The Legend of Zelda - Which order do you suggest for the games?,False,32,0,"Check this out!: https://imgur.com/a/aqzTapx

Two of the [most frequent questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/wiki/faq) we get posted here to r/Zelda are:

* *Which game should I start with?*, and  
* *Which game should I play next?*

Generally speaking, the typical answers to this are to start with whichever game, and play whichever game you can get next, as most games can be played in any order. 

That said, there are some games that are more popular than others, and some games that do have spoilers for others, and some games that are more similar to each other. So for someone looking for a little more context in making their decisions, it is nice to have that information organized.

About five years ago, /u/Vernalddpdwie made a helpful chart to guide players on choosing which game to play and [posted that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/73rrzg/i_made_this_flowchart_on_getting_into_the/).

This weekend, I have taken a shot at updating that chart, including showing for which platforms each game has released.

Overall, I recommend starting with ALttP, OoT, LA, or BotW - all available on Switch! Then based on what you like or dislike about those, you can branch out to other games. 

What do you think? Do you have comments on the updated chart? I am still looking to add a few more lines of text to it, so I am open to suggestions on additions or edits.",,11,,32,rito,public

zelda,[WW] Am I just bad at this game?,False,20,0,"For some background, I bought Wind Waker HD in June 2020 and have been playing it extremely sporadically since; I picked it up for the first time in 6-12 months a couple nights ago. The Zelda games I’ve played through are SS, OoT 3D, TP HD,  and BoTW, in that order, and I am the type of player that likes to explore things that are not part of the main quest; I would never collect 900 korok seeds, but I did all 120 shrines and all of Trial of the Sword.

So in Wind Waker I was stuck on how to get into the Earth and Wind Temples. The red dragon boat told me that I should ask for help from “those in the seas nearby” or something like that, and I assumed that meant the people living on nearby islands, so I went to Windfall Island and of course found nothing to help me. I eventually gave up and consulted a guide, which said needed to shoot a cyclone guy to get fire and ice arrows and then use the arrows to access the fire and ice islands, and I previously had no idea any of those even existed, let alone where to find them. The only other time I’ve felt this confused at how I was supposed to figure out how to do something in a Zelda game was when I played OoT and had to look up how to get inside Jabu-Jabu’s belly. So naturally I was curious at how the game meant for players to figure it out, and I realized that I had never learned there were fish people literally in the sea around each island that I could talk to.  I’ve never figured out how the treasure maps work either, and according to the guide I am supposed to have 16 hearts by now but I only have 6 or 7. I’d heard Wind Waker was supposed to be one of the easier and more enjoyable games, but clearly I’ve been missing a lot of things while playing. Am I just bad, or has the frequency of my playing been holding me back, or is the game more difficult puzzle-wise than the general consensus has made it out to be?",,15,,20,,public

zelda,[TP] My idea for a Twilight Princess sequel,False,1,0,"After Tears of The Kingdom is released, I really hope the next big Zelda game, is a direct sequel to Twlight Princess. Out of all of the mainline 3D Zeldas that deals with the typical ""stop Ganon from taking over Hyrule"" plot, TP is the only game in the series to not get a direct sequel, with the same incarnation of Link. Here are my ideas for a sequel.

• Ganon cannot return (he was killed in TP and is reincarnated in FSA)

• It doesn't take place in Hyrule

• It follows the same Link from TP and not a descendant (a la A Link Between Worlds)

Okay, so the game begins 1 month after TP. Link wants to find a way to reunite with Midna. Yes, it's sort of a retread on how OoT wanted to find Navi again. Anyways the story begins when Link chases an unknown figure and somehow ends up in another land via a portal. Eventually Link comes across a creature that he thought was Midna, but isn't. That creature becomes his partner for the game. I want there to be 6 dungeons, whereas TP had 8 (excluding Hyrule Castle) and MM only had 4. I also I want there to be these items called ""Mystery Orbs"" and they pretty much operate the same way as kinstone pieces from The Minish Cap. There are four types; red, blue, green, and yellow. The yellow ones progress the storyline and the rest are optional, for stuff like sidequests. I'm not sure who the villain will be. I want most of the game to keep the antagonist a secret and make the reveal shocking, when it finally comes time to reveal who he/she is. Anyways, does anyone want to contribute to my idea? Sure, it would be nice to see a BoTW3, but I don't want another one. I'm fine with two of those type of games. Funny how it took WW only 4-5 years to get a direct sequel, yet TP still doesn't have one, 16 years later.",,13,,1,,public

zelda,[MM3D] My goal: beat every main series Zelda game before Tears of the Kingdom comes out. Sixth is Majora's Mask 3D!,False,13,0,"Before Breath of the Wild came out, I had the idea of playing through every Zelda game before it released in no particular order. It didn't go well. So now I'm trying it again, hopefully giving myself enough time to actually accomplish it, and with a bit more organization. I gave myself three rules to work with for the series:

Main series entries only. No CDI games, no Link's Crossbow Training, no Four Swords, no Triforce Heroes. The last two are being left out due to their multiplayer focus, Four Sword Adventures will remain because it works just fine for single player.

The games will be played in the order of the original release date. If the game has a remake or HD version, I will play that version.

Rank the games as I go so I can get a clear picture of how things stack up over time.

New Note: Oh crap, I have an actual deadline now.

Game #6: Majora's Mask 3D

Once again, this post came late because I was playing through Xenoblade Chronicles 3 for 6 weeks.  On the bright side, I beat Majora's Mask in only 2 weeks, so I made pretty good time!

Majora's Mask is a game of ups and downs for me.  The atmosphere of this game is phenomenal—the different reactions to the impending moon crash from all the characters made it interesting to talk to everybody you could find.  Also, the dungeons are top notch.  Stone Tower Temple has one of the coolest dungeon gimmicks in any Zelda game and the others are no slouch.  Just a shame there was only three of them!

Expanding on the masks from OoT was a lot of fun and there were a handful that were pretty useful.  The Bunny Hood probably got the most use, but I wanted to shout out the Blast Mask as a clever use of game design.  Start the 3-day cycle and out of bombs?  No problem, just put this mask on!  Of course, the three transformational masks were great and probably the most memorable thing about this game.  On the flip side, there were a ton of masks that did nothing except get me a heart piece or two and that's kind of boring.

Now, for the cons.  The big one for me is the bosses in this game.  Quite frankly, aside from the Goht fight that was a lot of fun, they were either lame or frustrating.  The remake's attempts to make the fights more interesting didn't really help.  Trying to corral Gyorg towards the mines was frustrating; meanwhile, somehow the Twinmold fight was far slower in the giant form than just with the bow (though I did waste a boulder on doing absolutely nothing).  Also of frustration were the events tied to beating the boss of an area.  Sure, being able to fight the bosses again *voluntarily* is cool, but needing to fight the same boss multiple times because you couldn't quite get all the goodies of that area before you ran out of time was annoying.  Thank God I didn't have to fight Twinmold a second time.

All in all, I guess my biggest takeaway from Majora's Mask is that I wish there were more of the things it did incredibly well at: the dungeons!  The side quests were neat, and the Bombers' Notebook did a great job of keeping track of them all, but it was more than half the content.  I still had a good time of course, it's just that Majora's Mask is a game leaving me wanting more.

Next up is Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.  I suppose I'll probably do one post for them combined, but rank them separately.  They're intertwined, but still different games after all.

As well, there are apparitions near the base of Hyrule Castle and over Skull Lake, both which appear to cover something faintly red.

What if we got a game where an incarnation of Ganondorf actually fought against his destiny to be evil? What if he banished Demise’s spirit from himself and took the side of good? I imagine he would team up with Link and Zelda to unseal Demise from the Master Sword so as to destroy him for good.

zelda,[ToTK] Another Tears of the Kingdom Theory (Skyward Sword Spoilers),False,2,0,"So I had a thought. The Ouroboros in the title has to mean something. A lot of people think that the figure at the start of the trailer is the Goddess Hylia. People are also saying that there are a lot of references to Skyward Sword. My theory is that the just like how the battle between Ganondorf and Link is endless return (the meaning of Ouroboros) and the world of The Legend of Zelda undergoes the same process.

So at the beginning of SS it says ""One dark, fateful day, the earth cracked wide and malevolent forces rushed forth from the fissure."" The ground cracked and Hyrule castle rose from it. It also says ""The goddess gathered the surviving humans on an outcropping of earth. She sent it skyward, beyond the reach of the demonic hordes. Beyond even the clouds."" This outcropping could be made at the end of ToTK.

So if you haven't caught on yet I'm thinking that the end of ToTK is the beginning of SS. Also the master sword is broken so it might have all it's power drained from it and it might revert back to the goddess sword. So in conclusion my theory is that the ToTK is the last game in the timeline (not the last Legend of Zelda game) and at the same time is set before SS.

**Edit:** For those that don't like this theory, this does not mean they wont make anymore Zelda games. They can still put new games at any point in the timeline. The adult and child timeline still only have three games in them. ",,6,,2,,public

zelda,"[TotK] If Im not mistaken, Breath of the wild's Hyrule will be the first Hyrule to be present in more then 2 games.",False,1288,0,"It first appeared in BotW, after that in AoC and now in TotK. Thats 3 games with the exact same world. Has this ever happened in Zelda before?

[Edit] Okay so a lot of comments seem to mention canon and warriors not being part of Zelda so it doesn't count. Why is either of those things important here? Im merely talking about the almost near identical map APPEARING in 3 games (which it defenately does unless people have a really bad eye sight). Im sorry but why bring canon into this? And yes, I said ""...in Zelda..."" but that beggs the question why AoC isn't Zelda. Just because its officially a Warriors title and not A Zelda title doesn't change the fact that its all about BotW and its characters (unless, again, people have really bad eyesight). And yes I mentioned that I think it isn't important but some people like to zoom on evey single detail so I might as well point it out.

I indeed forgot about AlttP and AlbW with the ancient stone tablets which did feature the same map so I was simply wrong about it. Thats why I asked if it happened before in the first place. But now people are calling me out for purposefully being selective about which games to count and which not to count which litterally isn't my intention. I just forgot and I was wrong. 

And of course Hyrule is Hyrule and technacally its the same world because its the same timeline but as I said thats not important since that is not what I ment....

Sorry if yall think Im being rude. Thats not my intention. I just don't get why some people are adding (imo) unnecesary stuff to this and then be angry about it.",,297,,1288,,public

zelda,[MC] The Minish Cap is one of the most solid games I've ever played in a handheld console. How do you feel about it?,False,406,0,"I haven't beat it yet, but oh boy, the graphics and animations are impecable, the music is beautiful, the story so far is lovely and the mechanics and power-ups are well-achieved. The puzzles are perfectly balanced between fun and challenging and even though it has its flaws like the kinstone's mechanic (NPCs are too scatered through the map and that makes it difficult to find the correct ones) the game compensates them very well. I've only been playing this game for a day, but I played like, 4 hours non-stop, I felt almost addicted to it. I haven't felt this way since I played A Link Between Worlds many years ago, now I'm really optimistic about owning Link's Awakening for my Nintendo Switch.  
Anyway, I got to love this game from day one, and I'm surprised this isn't talked about too much, MC fans, please rise and tell me your thoughts about this beatiful game.",,82,,406,,public
zelda,[TotK] [BotW] Theory: Could the Leviathans within BotW hold larger significance in TotK?,False,58,0,"In BOTW, there exists gigantic skeletons of creatures referred to as ""Leviathans"". There are three leviathan skeletons in total, found at completely different areas in hyrule. There is one in Hebra, one in the Gerudo Desert, and one behind Death Mountain. So far, the only creatures who match their size are the three dragons. These dragons are able to be observed flying high above the clouds, and if you shoot any of them with arrows, they will make their way to a sort of portal high in the sky, after which they completely disappear.
Could this portal be one to the sky kingdom? Now, from the anatomy of the leviathans, we can assume that they were also capable of flight. This is a very important feature of the leviathans' anatomy that ties into this theory.

Why are these leviathans here? Where did they come from? And why are they so blatantly riddled across the map? (With the exception of the Hebra leviathan) And just how old are they exactly? This question has been raised many times throughout the lifespan of botw's theory community. From what we know, they were considered ancient well before the calamity.

After the new trailer we recently received during the nintendo direct, some have pointed out that there seems to be a sort of dragon-like creature hidden behind one of the sky islands, as we can see what appears to be a tail of sorts. Some have also pointed out that it doesn't seem to belong to any of the known dragons of hyrule. See where I'm going with this?

Some have theorized that we will be traveling back in time during the main story of TotK, to the great war thousands of years in the past. I am unsure if this is the case, but for the sake of this theory, I will consider this a possibility. If the sky Islands were a thing of the past, as many speculate, than could this dragon-esque creature be one of the leviathans? Could the leviathans have existed during this long-forgotten time? And if so, could the leviathans play a bigger role in the larger narrative? Perhaps they could play a similar role to the dragons in botw. But why, then, are they dead? Are they just normal creatures that existed alongside the ancient civilizations, unlike the dragons who represent the goddeses?",,10,,58,,public

zelda,"[WW] Wind Waker has one of the best art styles/atmospheres ever, in any game.",False,1263,0,"For some context, I'm not nostalgia blind for this game (I played the Wii U version only a few years ago when I was already a young adult) so I just want to eliminate that thought from people's mind.

God damn, something about this game's presentation just strike me some type of way. This game literally just feels like the happiest part of my childhood. It gives me the feeling of when I used to explore the massive woods that surrounded my small Pennsylvanian childhood home. The green leaves from the vegetation, the blue sky above dotted with clouds, and the somber pleasant breeze. Wind Waker just brings back all of those pure feelings that I had when I was a kid who'd go on imaginary adventures in the woods, swinging a big stick around like a sword.

Again, I never played this game when I was a kid, so these feelings don't come from association. The only other game I've ever vibed with on this level is Little Nightmares 2. Funnily enough, it's because that game made me feel things from my childhood too. I didn't have many friends when I was a little kid, so I did feel lonely and isolated a lot, and where I lived it stormed and rained constantly. Many days were overcast and dark. So whenever I play LN2 I get the feelings of calmness and somberness from my youth, and when I play the WW I feel my former upbeat happiness and sense of adventure.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way about Wind Waker, I know a lot of people still don't even like it's art style. But I just can't stop having these pure feelings of bliss whenever I play it.",,111,,1263,,public
zelda,[OoT] theory on the fallen timeline,False,5,0,"so i was watching a theory video by BanditGames on the abandoned timeline and i was thinking of how it could work and  
what if link only uses the master sword to go back in time once? when link first uses the master sword to go back in time he alters the past and that changes the future by normal time travel logic he has created a new timeline where the adult timeline happens, now what about the original timeline where he had first used the master sword to go back to his past and change the future? i believe this is the fallen timeline with link not being there anymore no one is left to stop ganon and he wins, but for this to happen it would mean that link only goes back in time once so that only 1 fallen timeline is created unless there are multiple fallen timelines and we only see 1 because they are all identical or well thats just a theory

zelda,[ALBW] What order do you do the dungeons in Link between Worlds?,False,12,0,"Personally, aLbW is my third favorite game in the franchise, and Definitely the most replayable/the one I replay the most, and I do so about once a year. I'm replaying it right now, and I always do the dungeons in almost the same order (because of items,) butI wanted to know if that was universal,or even if some people do different orders every time. So, what order do you do?

For me: Eastern Palace is required first, and then I don't really care between House of Gales and Tower of Hera, but typically do the House first because it's closer, and I want more hearts to fight Moldorm. Then Hyrule Castle obviously, and then in Lorule I always do Turtle Rock, Ice Ruins, Swamp Palace, Thieves' Town, Desert Palace, and then I again don't really care between Skull Woods and Dark Palace, though I typically do Skull Woods first because it's my least favorite of the Lorule Dungeons, so I don't want to end on it. Then Lorule Castle of course.

The reasoning is as follows; I never bother to get the Wooden Shield, because it burns up, so I prioritize getting the Hylian Shield. Then, I think the extended Magic Meter is the most useful, followed by the Blue Mail. Then I do Thieves' Town so I can do Desert Palace fifth, which is my favorite Dungeon in this game and one of my favorites across the whole series. I don't really care between the Light World Dungeons or between Skull Woods and Dark Palace because you either get no reward, or you get a reward that has to be used with other rewards to actually get anything, so I delay those the most.",,2,,12,,public

zelda,"[ToTK] What if the Figure in the mural is one of, if not the 3 Golden Goddesses that predate Hylia?",False,5,0,"From the newest trailer, we see that the mysterious Dragon looking figure whose holding onto the 7 teardrop looking symbols seem to have enough power to be the main deciding factor that stopped a previous Calamity ages past, despite the fact that the power of Goddess Hylia, through Princess Zelda by proxy, would've been present to ideally combat the encroaching malice. Furthermore, additional scenes from the mural further depict how this mysterious figure is also capable of either sealing Ganondorf/lifting Zelda out of Malice, (and how princess Zelda of ages past seemed to have some sort of relationship with this figure) 

While previous incarnations of Zelda and Link were definitely able to fight off Ganon and his forces, the longstanding assumption was that just the powers of those two was enough to truly fight off Ganon and his forces. This is especially since Zelda is blessed with the powers of Goddess Hylia, and each Link is the reincarnation of the titular Hero who slew Demise, the root of Ganon's origins. However, there has never been a single Antagonist in the entire Zelda franchise of which Link and Zelda's combined capabilities, alongside the help of supporting characters, isn't enough to end any of Hyrule's threats. The fact that this strange figure not only seems to be the key to ending a calamity of ages past DESPITE the presence of Link, Zelda, and the unified military might of Hyrule at least seem to suggest that this individual's capabilities are more along the lines of an ancient being like the dragons. 

However, its unlikely that this muraled figure is one of the ancient dragons is unlikely for   
2 reasons. First, even the original dragons from Skyward Sword likely wouldn't have the power necessary to be as game-changing as the mysterious figure in the mural was during one of the ancient calamities. As seen in Skyward Sword, even though Lanayru, Faron and Eldin all had the agency to stop Ganon and to safeguard the lands of Hyrule, when push came to shove it ultimately still fell to either Link or Zelda to salvage the situation. And while we haven't seen these ancient dragons in action, its unlikely that they have the ability to deal Demise a serious blow anyways simply because they didn't do anything to stop Ganon even though they had access to an entire mining apparatus for timeshift stones within the Lanayru province. 

Lastly, the current iterations of dragons introduced in BOTW, Dinraal, Farosh, and Naydra, don't have the abilities to stop ganon either as they're implied to each be roughly equal in power and influence, but yet Ganon was able to fully corrupt Naydra with just his malice form. 

Thus, if even the oldest and arguably most powerful iteration of ancient beings across the Zelda timeline are unlikely to be able to deal a serious blow to Ganon, then I find it unlikely that this unknown figure in the murals can be anyone that was previously seen in the timeline. Instead, the only other contenders could be the golden goddesses who birthed the world. Not only would they be the only ones who could rather easly clap either Hylia or Demise, but they've also been the last resort for when the world goes to shit. For instance, prior to the events of windwaker, the goddesses directly intervened by flooding the world before Ganon could kill off Hyrule. Even though Hylia could've intervened directly, the fact that those 3 still did means that they are not beyond directy salvaging Hyrule's impending doom.",,0,,5,,public
